Switch

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks EX4550 
line of Ethernet switches delivers 
scalable, high-performance 
platforms for supporting high-
density 10 gigabit per second 
(Gpbs) data center top-of-rack 
as well as data center, campus, 
and service provider aggregation 
deployments.

Product Description 
Featuring up to 48 wire-speed 1GbE or 10GbE small form-factor pluggable transceiver 
(SFP/SFP+) or 100M/1GBASE-T/10GBASE-T ports in a compact one rack unit (1 U) 
platform, the Juniper Networks® EX4550 Ethernet Switch delivers 480 Gbps of Layer 2 and 
Layer 3 connectivity to networked devices such as servers and other switches. Two versions 
of the EX4550 base switch are available: the EX4550-32F, a fiber-based version that 
provides 32 fixed 10GbE SFP/SFP+ pluggable ports; and the EX4550-32T, a copper-based 
version that supports 32 fixed 100M/1GBASE-T/10GBASE-T ports.  

Both versions feature two expansion slots, one in front and one in back, that can 
accommodate one of four optional expansion modules, providing tremendous 
configuration and deployment flexibility for campus and data center access and 
aggregation networks. The four expansion modules include:

• 

• 

• 

• 

 A 128 Gbps Virtual Chassis module

 An 8x10GBASE-T copper expansion module

 An 8x10GBASE SFP/SFP+ fiber expansion module

 A 2x40GbE QSFP+ expansion module

Architecture and Key Components
Virtual Chassis Technology

The EX4550 supports Juniper Networks’ unique Virtual Chassis technology, which enables 
up to 10 interconnected switches to operate as a single, logical device with a single IP 
address. Virtual Chassis technology enables enterprises to separate physical topology from 
logical groupings of endpoints and, as a result, provides efficient resource utilization. The 
EX4550 can participate in the same Virtual Chassis configuration with any combination 
of Juniper Networks EX4200 and EX4500 Ethernet Switches, delivering highly flexible and 
scalable configuration options for campus and data center deployments.  

EX4550 switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration can be connected using dedicated 128 
Gbps interconnect ports on the Virtual Chassis expansion module, or via link aggregation 
groups (LAGs) across 10GbE/40GbE ports, providing aggregate backplane capacity of up 
to 320 Gbps. 

In the data center, EX4550 Virtual Chassis deployments can extend across multiple top-
of-rack or end-of-row switches, providing tremendous configuration flexibility for 10GbE 
server connectivity by only requiring redundant links between Virtual Chassis groups rather 
than each physical switch to ensure high availability. In addition, mixed Virtual Chassis 
configurations featuring EX4200, EX4500, and EX4550 switches provide an ideal solution 
for data centers with a mix of 1GbE and 10GbE servers, or for environments transitioning 
from 1GbE to 10GbE server connectivity.

Data SheetData Center and Campus Advantages

The EX4550 delivers a highly available, simple, and scalable 
10GbE connectivity solution in a compact and power efficient 
platform, making it a perfect fit for both data center and campus 
networks. The EX4550 offers a number of other advantages for 
data center and campus deployments, including the following: 

Simple

Virtual Chassis technology on the EX4550 dramatically simplifies 
the campus aggregation layer, eliminating the need for Spanning 
Tree Protocol (STP), Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol 
(VRRP), complex routing, or VLAN configurations. In addition, 
when deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX4550 
also reduces the number of devices to manage and can even 
eliminate network switching layers. A single Virtual Chassis 
configuration can span multiple nodes, reducing the need for 
larger, more expensive nodes on superior tiers. Juniper Networks 
Junos® operating system, which is common across the entire EX 
Series switch product family, accelerates the learning curve by 
enabling the entire architecture to be managed with a common 
set of instructions and from a single pane of glass.

Scalable

A single EX4550 can support up to 48 10GbE ports at line rate, 
providing a highly scalable solution for even the most demanding 
environments. In addition, Virtual Chassis technology makes 

it easy to scale the network while reducing management 
complexity. By adding switches to a Virtual Chassis configuration, 
it is possible to grow the number of switch ports without 
increasing the number of devices to manage. As more switches 
are added to the Virtual Chassis configuration, backplane 
bandwidth demands can also be scaled to maintain adequate 
oversubscription ratios. EX4550 Virtual Chassis bandwidth can 
be increased to 256 Gbps by inserting 128 Gbps Virtual Chassis 
expansion modules in each of the two available expansion 
slots.  Virtual Chassis bandwidth can be further increased to 320 
Gbps by inserting a 40GbE expansion module into each of the 
available expansion slots.

Highly Available

When EX4550 switches are deployed in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration, Junos OS initiates a process to assign a master 
(active) and backup (hot standby) switch to manage the 
configuration. If the master switch fails, an integrated Layer 2 
and Layer 3 graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) feature 
automatically switches to the backup to maintain continuous 
and uninterrupted system operations. The EX4550 switch also 
includes a number of other high availability features, including 
redundant power and cooling, graceful protocol restart, equal-cost 
multipath (ECMP), LAG links distributed across multiple slots, and 
quality of service (QoS) to prioritize time-sensitive data.

Campus Deployments

As business grows, the network needs to evolve. With its 
compact 1 U form factor and complete switch features, the 
EX4550 can be easily redeployed in different environments and 
physical layouts. Customers can also easily transition from 1GbE 
to 10GbE using the dual-speed interfaces on the EX4550-32T or 
by replacing 1GbE optics with 10GbE optics on the EX4550-32F. 
EX4550 switch capacity can be expanded without increasing the 
number of managed devices by simply adding more switches to 
the Virtual Chassis configuration.

MACsec on the EX4550
A MACsec feature enables the EX4550 to support 480 Gbps 
of near line-rate hardware-based traffic encryption on all fiber 
ports, including the base unit and optional expansion modules.

Defined by IEEE 802.1AE, MACsec provides secure, encrypted 
communication at the link layer that is capable of identifying and 
preventing threats from denial of service (DoS) and intrusion 
attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle, masquerading, passive 
wiretapping and playback attacks launched from behind the 
firewall.  When MACsec is deployed on switch ports, all traffic 
is encrypted on the wire but traffic inside the switch is not.  This 
allows the switch to apply all network policies such as Quality of 
Service (QoS), deep packet inspection and sFlow to each packet 
without compromising the security of packets on the wire. 

Hop-by-hop encryption enables MACsec to secure 
communications while maintaining network intelligence.  In 
addition, Ethernet-based WAN networks can use MACsec to 
provide link security over long-haul connections.  MACsec is 
transparent to Layer 3 and higher- layer protocols and is not 
limited to IP traffic; it works with any type of traffic carried over 
Ethernet links.

The EX4550 offers an economical, power efficient and compact 
solution for aggregating 10GbE expansions from access devices 
in building and campus deployments (see Figure 1). The switch’s 
dual-speed interfaces also support environments transitioning 
from 1GbE to 10GbE.

The EX4550 easily meets enterprise core switch requirements, 
delivering wire-speed performance on every port, full device 
redundancy, support for Layer 3 dynamic routing protocols such 
as RIP and OSPF, L2 and L3 MPLS VPNs, and a comprehensive 
security and QoS feature set.

Data Center Deployments

The EX4550 Ethernet Switch is designed for demanding data 
center applications where high performance, high availability, and 
energy efficiency are key requirements (see Figure 2). Operating 
at wire speed, the EX4550 switches deliver 714 Mpps throughput 
and a data rate of 960 Gbps (full duplex) for both Layer 2 and 
Layer 3 protocols. EX4550 switches can be interconnected in 
a Virtual Chassis configuration that also includes EX4200 and 
EX4500 switches, creating a single logical device that offers a 
variety of port and density options for mixed server environments. 

Flexible deployment options enable the EX4550 to support back-
to-front and front-to-back cooling, which ensures consistency 
with server designs for hot and cold aisle deployments. Front and 
rear facing configuration options ensure closer proximity to server 
ports, optimizing performance and keeping cable lengths short 
and manageable.

The EX4550-32T switch ports can operate at 100 Mbps, 1 
Gbps and 10 Gbps using the same cable infrastructure, offering 
a simple and cost-effective way to migrate to higher-speed 
servers at the access layer.  In addition, the expansion slots on 
the EX4550-32T can support 10GbE SFP+ and 40GbE QSFP+ 
modules, which can be used as fiber uplinks or to extend 
connections beyond 100m. 

Customers introducing 10GbE into their server racks can use the 
EX4550 to add 10GbE-attached servers, iSCSI, and network-
attached storage (NAS) with minimal impact to the current 
switching infrastructure.

10GbE Data Center Bridging and I/O Convergence 
Deployments

The EX4550 is a full IEEE DCB- and T11 FC-BB-5-based Fibre 
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch, delivering a 
high-performance solution for converged server edge access 
environments. As an FCoE transit switch, the EX4550 provides a 
pure IEEE DCB converged access layer between FCoE-enabled 
servers and an FCoE-enabled Fibre Channel storage area network 
(SAN) (see Figure 4).  

The EX4550 also supports FC Initiation Protocol (FIP) snooping, 
which provides perimeter protection to ensure that the presence 
of an Ethernet layer does not impact existing SAN security 

policies. The FCoE transit switch functionality, along with priority-
based flow control (PFC) and Data Center Bridging Capability 
Exchange protocol (DCBX), are included as part of the default 
software; no additional licenses are required.

Junos Operating System

The EX4550 runs the same Juniper Networks Junos operating 
system that is used by other EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well 
as all Juniper Networks routers and Juniper Networks SRX Series 
Services Gateways. By utilizing a common operating system, 
Juniper delivers a consistent implementation and operation 
of control plane features across all products. To maintain 
that consistency, Junos OS adheres to a highly disciplined 
development process that uses a single source code, follows 
a single quarterly release train, and employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version. Customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.
