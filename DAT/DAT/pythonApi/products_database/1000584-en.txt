BTI800 Ethernet  
Access Devices

Product Overview

The BTI800 line of Ethernet 
access devices delivers high-
performance connectivity and 
aggregation for Carrier Ethernet 
business services and 4G LTE and 
LTE-Advanced mobile backhaul 
applications. The standards-
based, carrier-grade product 
family, which includes compact 
service access platforms and 
high-capacity service aggregation 
platforms, also supports unified 
management.    

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® BTI800 line of Ethernet access devices supports industry-
standard Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Carrier Ethernet 2.0 service types for high-capacity 
Ethernet business services and mobile backhaul (3G/4G/4G LTE and 4G LTE-Advanced) 
applications.

Tightly integrated with the Juniper Networks BTI7000 and BTI7800 product lines, the 
BTI800 Ethernet Access Devices represent the Ethernet metro service access and 
aggregation components of a complete end-to-end packet optical networking solution, 
delivering a cost-effective and seamless path to high-performance Ethernet services.

The BTI800 platforms leverage dedicated hardware for 1588v2 clock recovery, providing  
1 pulse per second and time-of-day GPS minimum recommended data sentence (GPRMC) 
outputs for phase and clock synchronization in mobile backhaul applications.

Comprehensive Provisioning, Monitoring, and Management
The BTI800 line supports in-band and out-of-band SNMP management as well as a 
command-line interface for configuration, monitoring, and control functions. The BTI800 
platforms feature hardware accelerated, industry-standard Y.1731 performance monitoring for 
measuring key service performance metrics, including latency, jitter, and frame loss. Built-in 
RFC2544 test methodology and Y.1564 service activation testing accelerate service turn-up, 
while Juniper Networks proNX Software and associated applications—including the proNX 
Service Manager, proNX Dashboard, and proNX SLA Portal—provide easy-to-use GUIs that 
simplify operations, accelerate service velocity, and optimize quality of experience with end-
to-end service provisioning and service-level agreement (SLA) monitoring.

BTI800 Models
The BTI800 line includes three models: the BTI805, BTI821, and BTI822.

BTI805 Ethernet Access Device

The BTI805 delivers high-performance connectivity for Ethernet business services and 
mobile backhaul applications.  The platform provides 40 Gbps nonblocking switching 
capacity in an ultra-compact design, enabling service providers to deliver price competitive, 
high-performance 10GbE access services while reducing operational costs and 
management complexity. This low power and temperature resilient platform is ideal for 
wireless tower sites and business customer premises.
