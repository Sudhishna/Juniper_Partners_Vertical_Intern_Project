Architecture and Key Components
The fixed-configuration EX2300-C line of Ethernet switches delivers complete Layer 2 
and basic Layer 3 switching capabilities to satisfy the low-density branch and low-density 
wiring closet connectivity requirements of today’s high-performance business needs. The 
EX2300-C models extend that reach into workgroup environments that reside outside the 
wiring closet, including branch offices, retail access applications, education, hospitality, and 
other locations where the switch is deployed in open areas inside a building.

Two versions are available. The EX2300-C-12T offers 12 front panel 10/100/1000BASE-T 
access ports and two SFP+ 10GbE uplink ports. The EX2300-C-12P offers 12 front panel 
10/100/1000BASE-T IEEE 802.3af/IEEE 802.3at (PoE/PoE+) access ports, which can be 
used for powering networked devices such as telephones, video cameras, multiple radio 
IEEE 802.11ac wireless LAN (WLAN) access points, and videophones in converged network 
environments. In addition, the EX2300-C-12P has two SFP+ 10GbE uplink ports.

The uplink ports can be used to connect to higher-layer devices such as aggregation 
switches or routers. The uplink ports can also be configured as Virtual Chassis interfaces 
and connected via standard 10GbE interfaces. A fixed internal power supply ensures 
operational simplicity.

Junos Fusion Enterprise Technology

Junos Fusion Enterprise technology provides automated network 
configuration and simplifies scalability for medium to large 
enterprise networks. Using the Juniper Networks EX9200 line of 
programmable switches as aggregation devices and EX2300-C 
switches as satellite nodes, Junos Fusion Enterprise technology 
can be deployed across a building (or multiple buildings) to 
connect large numbers of switches in a fabric that can be 
managed as a single device.

to the aggregation device(s) over a pair of fiber uplinks. Satellite 
devices or clusters can also be dual-homed or single-homed to 
the aggregation devices. 

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices forward all 
traffic to the aggregation device, enabling network administrators 
to monitor and manage the entire enterprise campus building from 
a single device. Features such as PoE/PoE+, LLDP-MED, and 802.1x 
are also supported in Junos Fusion Enterprise architectures to help 
meet enterprise campus requirements.

With Junos Fusion Enterprise technology, enterprises can reduce 
network complexity and operational costs by collapsing underlying 
network elements into a single logical point of control from Juniper 
Networks Junos operating system-based Juniper routing and 
switching platforms. It is designed for customers who need to 
cost-effectively deploy numerous switch ports throughout their 
enterprise campus network and manage them all from a central 
device. In addition, existing EX2300-C switches can be easily 
added to a Junos Fusion Enterprise deployment with a simple 
software upgrade, offering full investment protection.

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices do not 
require to be individually connected to aggregation devices. Up to 
four satellite devices can be interconnected via standard 10GbE 
interfaces to form a “cluster,” which, in turn, can be connected 

The EX2300-C supports Juniper’s unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, enabling up to four interconnected EX2300-C switches 
to be managed as a single logical device and delivering a scalable, 
pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding network environments. 
The EX2300-C can also be connected to an existing Virtual 
Chassis configuration composed of EX2300 switches.

While EX2300-C switches can be interconnected over either of 
the two front panel 10GbE uplink ports, these ports can also be 
configured as 1GbE uplinks to aggregation devices by disabling 
the Virtual Chassis technology.

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2300-C 
switches elect a primary and a backup switch based on a 
set of preconfigured policies or criteria. The master switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all other Virtual Chassis switch members. 
Switches can be added to or removed from the Virtual Chassis 
configuration without service disruption. 

EX2300-C Virtual Chassis configurations operate as highly 
resilient unified systems, providing simplified management using 
a single IP address, single telnet/SSH session, single command-
line interface (CLI), automatic version checking, and automatic 
configuration. The EX2300-C switches are also capable of local 
switching, so packets coming into a port destined for another 
port on the same switch do not have to traverse the Virtual 
Chassis, increasing forwarding capacities.

Figure 3: When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, up to four EX2300-C switches can operate as a single, logical device.

EX2300-C Virtual Chassis configurations implement the 
same slot/module/port numbering schema as other Juniper 
Networks chassis-based products, providing true chassis-like 
operations. By using a consistent operating system and a single 
configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration 
are treated as a single device, simplifying overall system 
maintenance and management.

Simplified Management and Operations

Junos Fusion Enterprise dramatically simplifies EX2300-C 
management by enabling a large number of the switches 
to be managed from a single management interface when 
deployed as satellite devices. With features such as plug-
and-play deployment and rolling software upgrades, Junos 
Fusion Enterprise eliminates the need to individually manage 
every access switch in the enterprise network, leading to lower 
operational costs and overall lower TCO.

Virtual Chassis technology simplifies network management 
for smaller deployments. Up to four interconnected EX2300-C 
switches can be managed as a single device utilizing a single 
Junos OS image and a single configuration file, reducing the 
overall number of units to monitor and manage. When the Junos 
OS is upgraded on the master switch in an EX2300-C Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the software is automatically upgraded on 
all other member switches at the same time.

Dedicated front panel RJ-45 and USB console ports offer flexible 
out-of-band management options, while a front panel USB 
port can be used to easily upload the Juniper Networks Junos 
operating system and configuration files. All front panel access 
and uplink ports have dedicated link status and link activity 
LEDs. In addition, a series of front panel LEDs offer system status 
information with a button that allows users to toggle through four 
different modes for reporting speed (SPD), duplex mode (DX), 
administrative status (EN), and PoE status (PoE). A fixed internal 
power supply ensures operational simplicity.

Easy Provisioning

Auto-configuration and Auto-Image Install features allow the 
switches to be configured and imaged over the network using the 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) message exchange 
process. These features eliminate the need to stage devices prior 
to deployment, dramatically reducing operational expenses. 
Auto-configuration and Auto Image Install allow new branches 
and retail stores to rapidly deploy their networks, and they also 
enable software upgrades and security fixes to be performed at 
the touch of a button. A zero touch provisioning (ZTP) feature 
allows a DHCP server to push configuration details and software 
images to multiple switches at boot-up time.

Juniper Networks Junos Space Network Director can manage the 
EX2300-C as a standalone switch as well as satellite devices in a 
Junos Fusion Enterprise deployment.

Features and Benefits
The EX2300-C model switches include a number of features that 
make them ideal for low-density, open space deployments.

Compact Form Factor

At 10.98 inches wide and 9.4 inches deep, EX2300-C switches 
can be easily and discreetly installed on desktops, on or under 
shelves, or on walls. An optional magnetic mounting pad is 
available for securing the EX2300-C switches to metal surfaces. 
Rack-mount kits are also available for installing the switches in 
standard 19-inch wiring racks. Wall mounting can be done using 
the flexible mounting slots on the bottom of the chassis to attach 
to the screws on the wall.

Silent Operation

The EX2300-C switches are fanless, resulting in a silent operation 
suitable for deployments in workgroup areas. The fanless design 
also reduces power consumption and improves mean time 
between failures (MTBF) by eliminating moving parts.

Data SheetEX2300-C Compact Ethernet SwitchLow Power

The fanless design reduces the power consumed by the 
EX2300-C switches. Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) ports ensure 
low power consumption when the network link is idle.

Access Security

Working as an enforcement point within the Access Policy 
Infrastructure, the EX2300-C provides standards-based 802.1X 
port-level access control as well as L2-L4 policy enforcement 
based on user identity, location, device, or a combination of 
these. If access is granted, the switch assigns the user to a 
specific VLAN based on authorization levels. 

The EX2300-C also provides a full complement of port security 
features, including DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection 
(DAI), and media access control (MAC) limiting to defend against 
internal and external spoofing, and man-in-the-middle and 
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Physical Security

Security slots on either side of the switch accept locking devices 
that physically secure switches, preventing them from being 
easily removed in open space or unsecured environments.

PoE/PoE+ Power

The EX2300-C-12P switch delivers power for supporting 
networked devices such as telephones, video cameras, IEEE 
802.11n WLAN access points, and videophones. It supports the 

IEEE 802.3af PoE standard, as well as IEEE 802.3at PoE+ with a 
budget of 124 watts. At maximum power, the 12-port EX2300-C-
12P can provide the full 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE to a maximum 
of eight ports simultaneously, and the full 30 watts of PoE+ to a 
maximum of four ports simultaneously. Attached devices draw 
the necessary power until the PoE power budget is exhausted.

Junos Operating System

The EX2300-C switches run the same Junos OS that is used by 
other Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, QFX Series 
Switches, Juniper Routers, Juniper SRX Firewalls, and the Juniper 
NFX Series Network Services Platform. By using a common 
operating system, Juniper delivers a consistent implementation 
and operation of control plane features across all products.

Enhanced Limited Lifetime Warranty

The EX2300-C switches include an enhanced limited lifetime 
hardware warranty that provides next business day advance 
hardware replacement for as long as the original purchaser owns 
the product. The warranty includes lifetime software updates, 
advanced shipping of spares within one business day, and 24x7
