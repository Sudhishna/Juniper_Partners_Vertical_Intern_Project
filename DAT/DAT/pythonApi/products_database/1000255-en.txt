Subscriber Management for MX 
Series 3D Universal Edge Routers

Product Overview

Service providers require ever 
increasing performance, scale, 
reliability, and operational 
efficiency at the broadband 
network edge, where a complex 
mix of routers and appliances are 
often implemented.  

Juniper Networks’ advanced 
subscriber management solution 
for MX Series 3D Universal Edge 
Routers is operationally proven 
in many of the world’s largest 
networks, and it provides the 
high performance, service agility, 
and reliability at scale needed 
to confidently consolidate and 
deploy next-generation residential 
and business broadband services. 

Product Description
Over the past several years, fixed broadband network operators have faced significant 
challenges to fully monetize their network investments and grow average revenue per user 
(ARPU). Competition abounds, with residential and business customers having access 
to multiple service providers in many markets. Additionally, the availability of 4G mobile 
services in some markets is also impacting customer acquisition and retention. Worse yet, 
with significant investment going toward mobile infrastructure upgrades and build-outs, 
fixed broadband network operators are being asked to do more with less.

While service providers traditionally maintain separate edge networks for their business 
and residential fixed broadband customers, the distinction between these markets has 
greatly diminished over the past few years. Both business and residential broadband edge 
networks must provide massive bandwidth, consistent high performance and quality 
of service (QoS), and high availability under all conditions and at all times. Given the 
economic pressure network operators are experiencing, the ability to consolidate these 
networks into a single cost-effective broadband service edge could provide a distinct 
competitive advantage. 

Juniper Networks® MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers are software-defined networking 
(SDN)-ready, and they provide routing, switching, services, advanced subscriber 
management, and virtualized functions that efficiently consolidate business and 
residential broadband networks. The MX Series combines high performance, reliability, 
and investment protecting scale to accommodate broadband edge requirements now 
and well into the future. Built on our powerful Juniper Networks Junos® operating system, 
these routers deliver an advanced subscriber management solution that simplifies network 
operations and increases network and service resiliency. Equally important, the subscriber 
management features include comprehensive support for IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4/IPv6 “dual 
stack” to ensure operations continuity on the migration path to IPv6.

The MX Series with subscriber management is deployed by hundreds of service providers 
globally, including some of world’s largest and most demanding networks.

Architecture and Key Components
Juniper Networks’ subscriber management solution incorporates 
features that ensure the quality delivery of broadband video 
services, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
Local Server and Relay for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients; flow- 
and port-based traffic shaping for rate assured, line speed 
independent service delivery; and the restriction of subscribers to 
a configurable number of multicast groups to avoid downstream 
bandwidth oversubscription.

The solution is fully integrated with policy servers and RADIUS 
to provide dynamic address assignment; service activation, 
modification, and deactivation; per-service and per-subscriber 
accounting; and functions for IPv4 and IPv6 addressed Point-to-
Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) and DHCP clients

Junos OS: A Robust Edge Starts with a Solid  
OS Foundation

Junos OS has a highly modular and reliable architecture that 
runs each processing function in its own protected memory 
space, with a single management process overseeing all kernel 
processes. Additionally, Junos OS supports nonstop forwarding 
(NSF), nonstop active routing (NSR), and unified in-service 
software upgrade (unified ISSU) to ensure continuous network 
operation and maximum uptime under adverse network 
conditions and during network upgrades. 

MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers for Residential, 
Business, and Mobile Applications

The MX Series has all the powerful routing, switching, security, 
service, and subscriber management features that are needed 
for true next-generation broadband edge networks. MX Series 
platforms range from 20 Gbps to an industry-leading 34.4 Tbps of 
capacity in a single chassis, and all use the programmable Junos 
Trio Chipset to drive performance, service agility, and subscriber 
scale for long-term investment protection in ever evolving edge 
markets.  

Management and Policy-Driven Automation for 
Next-Generation Services

Junos OS broadband subscriber management is fully integrated 
with Juniper Networks Junos Space Platform and the SRC 
Series Session and Resource Control portfolio. These platforms 
automate and simplify the entire spectrum of broadband 
network operations, administration, management, and 
provisioning tasks (OAM&P). Furthermore, the SRC Series 
supports differentiated service creation based on subscriber self-
serve, and time- and volume-based billing models.

Product Options

•  Virtual Chassis technology: Extends a common control 

plane across two or more MX Series routers while monitoring 
and managing them as a single logical device. Virtual Chassis 
technology increases resiliency, simplifies management by 
up to 88% compared with other redundancy schemes, and 
improves operational efficiency.

•  Virtual customer premises equipment (vCPE): Moves 
branch routing functions from elements on the customer 
premise to the network edge, enabling virtual cloud-based 
services such as managed L3 VPNs with integrated firewall 
capabilities. vCPE removes cost and complexity from the 
customer premise and improves service reliability and agility.
