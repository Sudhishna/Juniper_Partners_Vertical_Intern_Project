Junos Space  
Cross Provisioning Platform

Product Overview

Junos Space Cross Provisioning 
Platform (CPP) is a Junos 
Space application that acts 
like a “manager of managers” 
to provision services across 
multivendor devices. CPP 
facilitates provisioning of E-LINE, 
L2/L3 VPN, and virtual private 
LAN services (VPLS) between 
Juniper and third-party devices. Its 
framework can also be extended 
to support other vendors’ products 
through incremental research and 
development efforts.    

Product Description 
Traditional IT platforms such as operations/business support systems (OSS/BSS) are 
typically customized to meet a service provider’s specific service provisioning needs. These 
platforms and IT projects require huge upfront CapEx investments. Implementing a new 
service, or tweaking a small feature in an existing service profile, is an expensive endeavor 
that can take more than a year to accomplish in a typical service provider environment; by 
the time it is implemented, the service is often no longer relevant. 

As a Juniper Networks® Junos® Space application, Junos Space Cross Provisioning Platform 
(CPP) provides a “one-size-fits-all” solution that breaks the existing IT model by enabling 
service providers to quickly design and deploy new services in a multivendor network with 
minimal financial overhead. 

Service providers who need to provision services in a multivendor environment face 
multiple challenges, including:

•  Tying together element/network management systems (EMS/NMS) from different 

vendors and orchestrating services across a multivendor network

•  Quickly reacting to customer needs to deliver new services

•  Troubleshooting and maintaining services in a multivendor network

Architecture and Key Components
Junos Space CPP uses a script-based approach to service provisioning through the Flex 
Services framework, which facilitates flexible service creation and design without requiring 
a complicated software development cycle. Complex configurations such as quality of 
service (QoS), firewall policies, and business logic can be accommodated easily through 
the use of predefined scripts that allow network operators to:

•  Create a data model for a new service

•  Create a user interface to define new services

•  Define business logic for deploying the new service on Juniper and non-Juniper 

devices

• 

Implement complex workflows that provide orchestration and service chaining 
functionality

Junos Space CPP supports the following key functionality:

•  Common UI for managing services provisioned across only Juniper devices, only non-

Juniper devices, or a combination of both Juniper and non-Juniper devices

•  Multivendor service provisioning, including:

 -   Service resource management (route descriptor, route targets, etc.)

 -   Device and service discovery

 -   Templates for a variety of services

 -   Managed carrier Ethernet services (E-LINE/VLL, E-LAN, L3VPN, and IPTV L3VPN)

Device and Service Life Cycle Management 
Through Junos Space CPP
The typical life cycle of Juniper and third-party devices and 
services consists of four administrative tasks:

•  Discovery: Before a network operator can provision services, 
the targeted devices must be discovered. While Junos Space 
CPP natively discovers Juniper devices through the Junos 
Space infrastructure, it uses a third-party adapter to make 
appropriate calls into third-party network management 
systems to retrieve device inventory information. 

•  Provisioning: Junos Space CPP provides the functionality 

required to apply default configurations to Juniper 
devices depending on their roles, and it includes a flexible 
framework for provisioning services across multivendor 
devices. The third-party adaptor invokes provisioning 
services using the northbound interface (NBI) of the 
third-party device’s NMS, which also pushes the required 
configuration to Juniper devices through the Junos Space 
Service Activation infrastructure.

•  Modification: Junos Space CPP allows service operators to 

easily modify already deployed services. With Juniper devices, 
this can be done for device and service configurations. 
With third-party devices, modifications can be applied to 
existing service configurations. In addition, CPP also allows 
modifications to be made against a set of services or a 
set of devices. Alternatively, operators can decommission 
individual or sets of services deployed on third-party devices. 
Modifications can include migrating services from one port to 
another or across different chassis.

A typical Junos Space CPP installation requires a license for 
base software functionality. Additional optional licenses are 
required for the number and types of ports being managed by the 
application. For customers who wish to automate the services 
provisioning process, a REST API library option is also available 
for purchase.

•  Troubleshooting: Junos Space CPP provides the ability to 

troubleshoot Juniper devices through the use of operational 
scripts. Troubleshooting provides granular, service-specific 
details and enables service providers to quickly pinpoint 
network problems. Periodic reports can also be generated 
that provide important service-related statistics. 

Multivendor Provisioning— 
Currently Supported Functionality 
In order to provision end-to-end services between Juniper 
and Alcatel-Lucent devices, Junos Space CPP invokes service 
provisioning templates in Junos Space and Alcatel-Lucent’s 
5620 SAM server for configuring the Juniper and Alcatel-Lucent 
devices, respectively. Communication with the 5620 SAM is via 
SOAP API calls.
