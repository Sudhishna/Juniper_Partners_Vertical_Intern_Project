SRX1400 Services 
Gateway 

Product Overview

SRX Series Services Gateways are 
next-generation firewalls based 
on a revolutionary architecture 
offering outstanding protection, 
performance, scalability, 
availability, and security service 
integration. Custom designed for 
flexible processing scalability, 
I/O scalability, and services 
integration, the SRX Series 
exceeds the security requirements 
of data center consolidation 
and services aggregation. The 
SRX Series is powered by Junos 
OS, the same industry-leading 
operating system platform 
that keeps the world’s largest 
networks available, manageable, 
and secure for the data center.

Product Description 
The SRX1400 Services Gateway is a professional-grade platform for security ideally suited 
for small to mid-size data centers, enterprise, and service provider network deployments 
where consolidated functionality, uncompromising 10 Gbps performance, compact 
environmental footprint, and affordability are key requirements.

The SRX1400 expands the SRX Series family of next-generation firewalls, delivering 
market-leading performance and extensive service integration to 10GbE environments 
where the features are required without the massive scalability provided by SRX3000 and 
SRX5000 lines.

In terms of security, the SRX1400 features next-generation firewall services such as 
application security, Unified Threat Management (UTM) and Intrusion Prevention System 
(IPS). Integrated threat intelligence via Spotlight Secure offers adaptive threat protection 
against command and control (C&C) related botnets and policy enforcement based on 
GeoIP and attacker fingerprinting technology (the latter for Web application protection)—
all of which are based on Juniper provided feeds. Customers may also leverage their own 
custom and third-party feeds for protection from advanced malware and other threats.

The SRX1400 is available in two base configurations offering a choice of built-in high-
density 1GbE ports or combination of built-in 10GbE ports and 1GbE ports. For enhanced 
flexibility, the SRX1400 can use the integrated SRX1400 NSPC processing card or use 
separate NPC and SPC cards from the SRX3000 line, simplifying sparing logistics and 
interoperability. The appliance includes one expansion slot on the front panel.

Purpose-built to protect 10GbE network environments, the SRX1400 consolidates multiple 
security services and networking functions in a highly-available appliance. Featuring 
a modular design that uses common form-factor modules serviceable from the front 
panel, the SRX1400 incorporates innovation that improves reliability, enhances network 
availability and delivers deterministic performance of concurrent security services at scale.

Combining Juniper’s Dynamic Services Architecture and Juniper Networks Junos® operating 
system with carrier-class features based on the proven design of the SRX3000 line of 
services gateways, SRX1400 sets a new standard in value by extending the SRX Series data 
center line to cost-effectively satisfy network security requirements in smaller environments. 
Each SRX1400 Services Gateway consolidates multiple security services in one chassis under 
one integrated security policy, while delivering the uncompromised performance needed to 
support 10GbE environments in today’s high-performance networks. 

Purpose-Built for Network Security Professionals

The SRX1400 is a carrier grade appliance designed from the ground up for long, trouble-
free service life of continuous operation in demanding, high-performance data center 
network environments. Designed and produced using a TL 9000 registered quality 
management system, the SRX1400 is 100% Juniper software, support services and

Data Sheethardware including innovative new chipsets to separate control 
and user planes, enabling performance to scale to new levels 
required to meet the needs of high performance networks. 

Dynamic Services Architecture 

The high-end SRX Series uses the Juniper Dynamic Services 
Architecture to distribute data sessions between multi-core 
processing resources dynamically, on-the-fly. Instead of binding 
network traffic and services to specific CPU cores and processing 
resources in a fixed or rigid manner, as other vendors do, Dynamic 
Services Architecture balances traffic session processing 
work load dynamically within a pool formed from all available 
resources. This avoids an all-too-common situation experienced 
on general-purpose computing platforms used for security, where 
a subset of resources operate at or near their maximum limits 
while other resources are under-used or idle.

The Dynamic Services Architecture in SRX Series services 
gateways is what enables Juniper to deliver massive scalability, 
market-leading throughput, and deterministic performance 
with multiple security services operating concurrently. With the 
chassis-based SRX Series gateways, additional processing cards 
can be easily installed adding to the resource pool as your traffic 
grows over time.

Centralized Management 

Juniper Networks Junos® Space Security Director delivers scalable 
and responsive security management that improves the reach, 
ease, and accuracy of security policy administration. It lets 
administrators manage all phases of the security policy lifecycle 
through a single Web-based interface, accessible via standard 
browsers. Junos Space Security Director centralizes application 
identification, firewall, IPS, NAT, and VPN security management 
for intuitive and quick policy administration. 

Junos Space Security Director runs on the Junos Space 
Management Platform for highly extensible, network-wide 
management functionality, including ongoing access to Juniper 
and third-party Junos Space ecosystem innovations.

SRX1400 Architecture and Key 
Components
Based on the time-tested, proven design of the SRX3000 line, 
the SRX1400 delivers deterministic performance optimized 
for 10GbE. A functional SRX1400 system consists of a base 
configuration together with a Network and Services Processing 
Card (NSPC) designed specifically for the SRX1400, or a 
combination of base configuration together with interchangeable 
SRX3000 line processing cards. The capability of the SRX1400 
to use SRX3000 line cards can provide significant advantages 
and a lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Customers can 
simplify operations and maintenance by using one common 
security policy and a common set of spares that are compatible 
and interoperable between SRX1400 and SRX3000 line 
services gateways. Policy and configuration backup and restore 

operations, equipment replacements, migration and upgrade 
from SRX1400 to the SRX3000 line are straightforward.

With the exception of the hot-swappable fan tray, which is 
accessible from the rear panel, all modules and connections on 
the SRX1400 are accessible from the front panel. 

Choice of Base Systems 

Two base systems are available for the SRX1400 - a GE version 
and an XGE version. Both base system versions include a discrete 
Routing Engine module, one power supply (AC or DC), and a fan 
tray assembly.

GE-Base System

The GE-Base System contains twelve GbE ports. Six of the 
twelve GbE ports are 10/100/1000 copper (RJ45), and six are 
1000BASE-X. Two of the six 1000BASE-X ports can be used for 
either high availability (HA) cluster control or as data ports. The 
1000BASE-X ports accept small form-factor pluggable (SFP) 
transceivers which are available in copper, short reach (SX) 
multimode (MM fiber) and long reach (LX) single mode (SM fiber). 

XGE-Base System

The XGE-Base System contains three ports of 10GbE and nine 
ports of GbE. Six of the nine GbE ports are 10/100/1000 copper 
(RJ45) and three are 1000BASE-X. Two of the three 1000BASE-X 
ports can be used for either HA cluster control or as data ports. 
The 1000BASE-X ports accept SFP transceivers which are 
available in copper, SX (MM fiber) and LX (SM fiber). The three 
10GbE ports accept SFP+ transceivers which are available in SR 
(MM fiber), LR (SM fiber), and ER (SM fiber).

In addition to a base system, processing resources—either one 
integrated NSPC, or the combination of one SRX3000 line NPC, 
one SRX3000 line SPC, and one double wide tray—must be 
installed in order to have an operational system. 

Options 

Optional modules that can be added include one additional 
(redundant) power supply (AC or DC) and one IOC for additional 
Ethernet connectivity. The SRX3000 line and SRX1400 use the 
same interchangeable IOC modules. The SRX1400 is designed 
for future expansion, including the ability to accommodate next-
generation silicon from Juniper Networks.

SRX1400 NSPC1

Providing the power inside the SRX1400, the integrated NSPC is 
optimized to perform all packet processing and inspection for all 
available services on the platform. The Juniper Dynamic Services 
Architecture manages the multiple cores of processing power on 
the NSPC as one pool or reservoir of resources, and dynamically 
allocates resources to services as needed. To ensure maximum 
processing performance and flexibility, the SRX Series high-end 
products use network processors (NPCs) to distribute inbound 
and outbound traffic to SPCs and IOCs, apply QoS, and enforce 
protection from DoS/DDoS attack scenarios.

2

Data SheetSRX1400 Services Gateway SRX3000 Line NPC and SPC

The SRX1400 will interoperate with the SRX3000 NPC and SPC 
cards. In order to use the SRX3000 line NPC and SRX3000 SPC in 
the SRX1400, it is necessary to use the optional double wide tray.

I/O Cards (IOC)

Supporting a wide variety of use cases and to accommodate 
interfacing between different Ethernet standards, the SRX1400 
provides for additional front panel I/O to complement the 
excellent port density provided in the base system. SRX1400 and 
SRX3000 line of products use the same IOCs interchangeably. 

Each SRX1400 Services Gateway can accommodate one 
additional IOC; either 16 gigabit interfaces (16 x 10/100/1000 
copper GbE or 16 x 1000BASE-X fiber GbE), or two 10GbE 
interfaces (2 x 10GbE XFP Ethernet).

In addition, the SRX1400 and SRX3000 line also has a combined 
NPC/IOC card (NP-IOC). This card expands the gateway’s 
performance by serving two functions, network processing and 
input/output, with just one card in one slot. Like the other cards, 
this one supports in-service software upgrades; In addition, it 
also supports in-service hardware upgrades. It is fully, backward 
compatible with the current SRX1400 chassis and cards. 

Power Supplies

The SRX1400 accommodates one or two AC or DC power 
supply modules. Each individual power supply is fully capable 
of furnishing all of the power the SRX1400 needs. The second 
power supply is redundant to the first and is used to increase 
availability in the event of a power supply failure. Power supplies 
are hot-swappable, Network Equipment Building System (NEBS-
III) ready, and accessible from the front panel.

Features and Benefits
Loaded with features and optimized for 10GbE networks, the SRX1400 has many attributes that make it superior to other products
