Juniper Sky Advanced  
Threat Prevention  

Product Overview

Sky Advanced Threat Prevention 
is a cloud-based service that 
provides complete advanced 
malware protection. Integrated 
with SRX Series Services 
Gateways, Sky Advanced Threat 
Prevention delivers a dynamic 
anti-malware solution that can 
adapt to an ever-changing threat 
landscape. 

Product Description 
As malware evolves and becomes more sophisticated, it grows more difficult for 
conventional anti-malware products to effectively defend against these types of attacks. 
Juniper Networks® Sky Advanced Threat Prevention provides advanced anti-malware and 
anti-ransomware protection against sophisticated “zero-day” and unknown threats by 
monitoring ingress and egress network traffic looking for malware and other indicators of 
compromise. Using a pipeline of technologies in the cloud, Sky Advanced Threat Prevention 
delivers progressive verdicts that assess the risk level of each potential attack, providing a 
higher degree of accuracy in threat prevention. Hosted securely in the cloud, Sky Advanced 
Threat Prevention integrates with Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways to 
deliver deep inspection, inline malware blocking, and actionable reporting. 

Sky Advanced Threat Prevention’s identification technology uses a range of techniques to 
quickly identify a threat and prevent an impending attack. These range from rapid cache 
lookups to identify known files to dynamic analysis using unique deception techniques 
applied in a sandbox environment to trick malware into activating and self-identifying. 
Patented machine learning algorithms allow Sky Advanced Threat Prevention to adapt and 
identify new malware in the ever-changing threat landscape. Both web- and e-mail-based 
attacks are defended, protecting the organization from the most prominent threat vectors.

Using evolving techniques that take into account multiple attributes and behaviors of large 
datasets, Sky Advanced Threat Prevention can also identify zero-day attacks and eliminate 
threats before an attacker infiltrates the network. Once identified, the malware’s signature 
is recorded in the lookup cache and widely propagated to stop similar attacks in the future.

Data SheetArchitecture and Key Components
Sky Advanced Threat Prevention leverages Juniper’s next-
generation SRX Series firewall platforms and a cloud-based service 
component for all management, configuration, and reporting.

Sky Advanced Threat Prevention’s progressive pipeline analysis 
engine starts with a cache lookup against a database of known 
threats. This is accomplished in near real time and facilitates 
inline blocking of malicious content. Suspicious files are 
subjected to a series of deeper inspection steps that attempt 
to positively identify malware. Static analysis combined with 
processing through multiple antivirus engines attempts to 
identify the threat; if a file is identified as malware through 
analysis, its signature is added to the cache to ensure immediate 
identification of recurring threats in the future. 

Finally, dynamic analysis is applied in a sandbox environment, 
where the threat is “detonated” and observed. Unique deception 
techniques are employed to elicit malware response and self-
identification. Threats that slip by during the more extensive 
analysis stage are identified, logged, reported, and can be 
easily mitigated by security operations staff. Infected hosts are 
automatically isolated and blocked from outbound network access 
by delivering an “infected host” feed to the SRX Series device.

Sky Advanced Threat Prevention utilizes public cloud infrastructure 
to deliver a flexible and scalable solution. All communications 
between the SRX Series device and the cloud are secure, 
conducted over encrypted connections on both sides. Files 
uploaded to the cloud for processing are destroyed afterward to 
ensure privacy. A detailed description of the Sky Advanced Threat 
Prevention privacy policy, as well as the broader Juniper Networks 
privacy policy, can be found on the product web portal at https://
sky.junipersecurity.net/.

Features and Benefits
Integrating with next-generation SRX Series firewalls for 
detection and enforcement allows Sky Advanced Threat 
Prevention to provide dynamic, automated protection against 
known malware and advanced zero-day threats, resulting in 
nearly instantaneous threat responses.

Features and capabilities include:

•  Windows 7, Windows 10, and Android operating system 

support

•  Deep analysis and sandboxing support for multiple file 

types including executables, PDFs, MS Office files, archives, 
and Flash

•  Support for HTTP, HTTPs, and SMTP protocols

•  Comprehensive logging and integration with Juniper Secure 
Analytics (JSA) and IBM QRadar SIEMs allows rapid threat 
analysis and incident response

• 

Integration with Junos Space Security Director Version 16.1 
simplifies security policy management and monitoring using 
an intuitive centralized interface

•  Fast verdict capability that enables the SRX Series firewall 

to block malicious traffic in inline blocking mode

•  Scalable secure cloud infrastructure that, when a threat is 

discovered, shares updates globally among customers in 
near real time to block additional attacks

•  Patented pipeline of technologies to analyze sophisticated 

malware, “detonate” files in a controlled sandboxing 
environment, and identify zero day threats

•  Comprehensive API support to programmatically deliver 

dynamic threat intelligence feeds and upload files for analysis

•  Rich set of curated threat feeds to proactively block 

outbound command and control (C&C) communication

•  Full-featured, web-based portal to provision, monitor, 

and manage services, as well as a rich set of reports and 
analytics to provide customers with deep visibility into 
threats and potentially compromised hosts

•  Ability to upload suspicious files through the Web UI  

for processing

•  Deep analytics that identify compromised systems; this 

information is propagated to SRX Series firewalls via 
infected host feeds to quarantine compromised systems in 
near-real time

• 

Inspection of all e-mail attachments for malware; Sky 
Advanced Threat Prevention supports the SMTP e-mail 
protocol* and offers flexible policy enforcement options 
including quarantine and Tag-and-Deliver, while admin and 
end-user notifications ensure a full lifecycle workflow and 
superior user experience.

•  Ability to track infected endpoints by MAC address and 

account for changing IP addresses using the Juniper 
Networks Policy Enforcer component (for more information, 
please read the Policy Enforcer data sheet)

Product Options
Sky Advanced Threat Prevention is available in two forms: 
Premium, which offers full advanced malware protection; and 
Basic, which provides threat feeds only. Customers who do 
not require full file-based advanced malware protection can 
purchase the Basic version to protect their organizations from 
botnets, command and control, phishing, and other attacks that 
can be addressed using threat intelligence feeds. Customers who 
want full protection from sophisticated malware, which requires 
content inspection, should purchase the Premium offering. The 
two versions are described in Table 1. 

* Note: E-mail (SMTP) scanning is only supported on the SRX1500, SRX5000 line,  

and SRX4000 line of Services Gateways at this time and requires Junos 15.1X49-D80 or 
higher releases.

Note: 
Sky Advanced Threat Prevention requires the AppSecure functionality to be available. In 
addition to the standalone Sky Advanced Threat Prevention license, individual SRX Series 
platforms might require additional licenses as described below. 
• On the SRX550M, SRX5000, and vSRX platforms, the AppSecure license is available for 

purchase a la carte or through a bundle SKU that includes the license.

• The SRX340 and SRX345 are available with a JSE bundle that includes AppSecure. 

AppSecure can also be purchased a la carte if JSE is not purchased.

• On the SRX4000 platforms, the JSE software bundle includes a license for AppSecure
• The SRX1500 requires a mandatory purchase of the JSE bundle, which includes the 

AppSecure license. Consequently, the standalone Sky ATP license will suffice.
