BTI7802 Packet Optical  
Transport System

Product Overview

Legacy wavelength-division 
multiplexing (WDM) systems 
can’t meet the capacity and price/ 
performance demands of today’s 
metro networks. Today’s content 
providers, colocation providers, 
and service providers require a 
new generation of extremely 
compact and simple-to-manage 
100/200 Gbps optical platforms 
to interconnect data centers 
and support contemporary 
applications.

The BTI7802 Packet Optical 
Transport System provides large-
scale 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 
200 Gbps wavelength capacities 
with industry-leading density and 
performance.  

  

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® BTI7802 Packet Optical Transport System is specifically designed 
to meet the unique power, space, and manageability requirements of access networks and 
small sites with limited space. Ideal for end-customer deployments and edge aggregation 
applications, this compact platform supports up to eighty 10 Gbps, eight 100 Gbps, or four 
200 Gbps interfaces in a cost-effective 3 U footprint. The BTI7802 leverages a modular, 
flexible, pay-as-you-grow architecture.

Architecture and Key Components
At the heart of the BTI7802 are flexible Universal Forwarding Modules (UFMs), each 
capable of switching up to 400 Gbps. UFMs can be equipped with 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, 
or 200 Gbps interfaces, providing the flexibility to support a wide variety of muxponder 
and transponder connectivity. Optimized for metro and regional networks, the BTI7802 
supports a wide range of interfaces, including 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, 200 Gbps, OTU2, OTU4, 
and OC-192/STM-64.

The BTI7802 provides a seamless upgrade path from 10 Gbps to 200 Gbps, as well as an 
easy migration to future higher bandwidth interfaces. Integrated reconfigurable optical 
add-drop multiplexer (ROADM)-on-a-blade modules, optional amplifiers, and protection 
switches satisfy diverse capacity, span and reach requirements. The BTI7802 cost-
effectively optimizes equipment expenses to enable increases in the capacity of existing 
networks and support new service deployments.

The SDN-enabled BTI7802 is supported by the comprehensive Juniper Networks proNX 
software product line that streamlines network operations, as well as open APIs that 
simplify integration with external operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS). 
The proNX software enables easy integration with back-office systems and applications 
through open RESTful APIs. It provides point-and-click service provisioning, fault and 
performance monitoring, and troubleshooting for the BTI7802. It also delivers a concise 
view of the health and performance of all BTI7800 networking platforms, enabling more 
proactive and efficient network management.

A carrier-grade solution, the BTI7802 supports redundant processors, power supplies, and 
service modules. The BTI7802 features a multi-slot, multichassis architecture for ultimate 
flexibility and scalability. Ideal for small site and end-customer deployments, the platform 
also supports AC and DC power options and in-band monitoring.
