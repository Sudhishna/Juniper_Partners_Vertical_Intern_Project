EIGHT-PoRT 
SyNCHRoNoUS SERIAL 
GIGABIT-BACKPLANE 
PHySICAL INTERFACE 
MoDULE (GPIM)  

Product Overview

Providing the physical connection 
to serial network media types, 
Juniper’s eight-port synchronous 
serial Gigabit-Backplane Physical 
Interface Module (GPIM) is used for 
the Juniper Networks® SRX550 and 
SRX650 Services Gateway products 
to increase bandwidth capabilities for 
synchronous serial connectivity and 
provide high density aggregation.

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks eight-port synchronous serial GPIM provides the physical connection 
to serial network media types, receiving incoming packets from the network and 
transmitting outgoing packets to the network. The eight-port synchronous serial GPIM 
forwards packets for processing while performing framing and line-speed signaling.

Features and Benefits
The Juniper Networks eight-port synchronous serial GPIM provides increased bandwidth 
capabilities for synchronous serial connectivity as well as high density aggregation, while 
making effective use of the SRX550 and SRX650 interface slots. Features include:

•	 60-pin synchronous serial (female) connector type
•	 Support for the following standards: TIA/EIA 530, EIA 530A, V.35, X.21, RS-232, RS-449
•	 Up to 8 Mbps per physical port
