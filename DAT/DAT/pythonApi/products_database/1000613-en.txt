AppFormix

Product Overview 

Today’s software-defined cloud 
infrastructure and associated 
workloads are massive, dynamic, 
and highly elastic. To operate 
effectively, such infrastructure 
not only requires the ability to 
adapt to the rate of change, but 
also the intelligence to anticipate 
and prevent future risks and 
satisfy emerging demands, all in 
real time.

AppFormix is built from the 
ground up to address these 
challenges with ease of use in 
mind. AppFormix enables cloud 
infrastructure to be “self-driving” 
by automating operations with 
real-time visibility, predictive 
analysis, and real-time 
orchestration and optimization 
capabilities.

 

Product Description
Juniper Networks® AppFormix leverages big data analytics and machine learning as part of 
a distributed analysis platform, making the power of self-driving infrastructure available at 
the core of the cloud. AppFormix redefines state-of-the-art telemetry and management 
across software-defined infrastructure and application software layers, delivering real-
time and historic monitoring, performance visibility, and dynamic optimization features to 
improve cloud orchestration, security, accounting, and planning for users.

AppFormix operates in hybrid, private, and public enterprise and telco cloud environments 
built on platforms such as OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
AppFormix manages containers, virtual machines, and virtualized network functions (VNFs) 
to support multitenant, dynamic, and constantly evolving cloud infrastructure and workloads.

Data SheetAppFormix analyzes metrics in real time across all aspects of 
shared infrastructure—compute, storage, and networking—and 
associates resource consumption with containers and virtual 
machines. Operators use AppFormix to control and visualize 
how infrastructure resources are utilized by workloads, in order 
to plan for and provide adequate capacity to ensure smooth 
application performance.

AppFormix provides operators of software-defined data centers 
with a comprehensive toolset that offers visibility into operational 
performance and infrastructure resources.

Architecture and Key Components
AppFormix provides resource control and visibility for hosts, 
containers, and virtual machines in any cloud infrastructure.

The AppFormix software consists of multiple components:

•  A smart agent to monitor and analyze resource usage on 

infrastructure devices (compute, network, storage, etc.)

•  A Platform Controller, which offers REST APIs to configure 

the system

•  A DataManager, which distributes and stores data from 

multiple agents

•  Analytics modules that correlate and analyze events across 

the entire infrastructure

•  A dashboard, which provides a web-based user interface

•  Adapters, which discover platform-specific resources and 

configure the Controller (adapters exist for OpenStack, 
Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, and Contrail SDN)

Agents run on the resource devices of the infrastructure that 
provide the compute, network, and storage resources required to 
execute and connect application workloads both in and across 
clouds. A compute node may be a bare-metal host or a virtual 
machine (VM). The network resource devices can be physical or 
virtual as well. 

With a built-in distributed analytics engine, AppFormix Agent 
processes and analyzes raw resource metrics on-the-fly and at the 
source before sending useful signals to the rest of the system. Such 
advanced technology and distributed architecture ensure timeliness 
of the operational data as well as scalability of the deployment.

The remaining components run on a class of “infrastructure 
nodes,” such as the OpenStack infrastructure service nodes 
or Kubernetes master nodes, which execute services that 
power software-defined infrastructure. The host on which 
the AppFormix platform components execute, known as an 
AppFormix platform host, can be either a physical server or a VM.

eFeatures and Benefits
Real-Time Metrics and Alarms

A “metric” is a measured value for an element in the 
infrastructure, providing operators with essential visibility into 
all facets of an infrastructure. AppFormix Agent collects and 
calculates comprehensive metrics, in real time, for hosts and 
instances, as well as for networks, storage, services, and other 
elements. These metrics are then displayed in the AppFormix 
Dashboard as real-time charts and reports. 

With AppFormix, an operator can also configure alarms against 
values or conditions of metrics or groups of metrics within the 
infrastructure. Whenever these configured values or conditions 
are met, alarms are triggered in real time to notify the operator. 
AppFormix software also plots these alarms on charts in both 
real time and time-series fashion, giving the operator a holistic 
view of current status as well as past trends. 

Figure 6: AppFormix Alarms screen

Machine Learning

AppFormix can apply machine learning to dynamically learn 
and baseline the performance of applications and infrastructure 
elements while they operate, generating alarms when real-
time metrics deviate from historical trends that exceed a user-
configured tolerance level. The result is a monitoring policy that 
is aware of the dynamic nature of workloads that place differing 
resource demands over time. Operators can also leverage 
this machine learning capability to monitor applications and 
infrastructure elements when the performance profile and 
operational boundaries are not yet known.

Health Monitor

The AppFormix Dashboard provides operators with a quick 
and intuitive overview of the health and projected risk of the 
infrastructure and its workloads via the Health Monitor pane. 
Health status can indicate whether a resource is currently 
operating outside a user-specified performance policy, while risk 
uses historical trends to determine whether a resource may be 
unhealthy in the future.

For example, if the AppFormix Platform Controller is not receiving 
heartbeats from a host, then that host and all of its instances 
will be marked as unhealthy with a condition called “missed 
heartbeat.”

Figure 7: AppFormix Health Monitor

While AppFormix supplies a default set of health and risk 
profiles, users may also configure customized profiles to suit their 
environment.

Notifications

When alarms are triggered, in addition to the graphical 
representation on the dashboard UI, AppFormix also provides 
users with the ability to notify external systems of the alarms.

For each alarm, AppFormix can post a structured description 
of an event as a JSON payload to an external HTTP endpoint. 
These notifications can be used to initiate any action or workflow, 
whether it is corrective, preventive, or otherwise, to keep the 
infrastructure and its workloads operating in their optimal state.

For operators’ convenience, AppFormix comes pre-integrated 
with PagerDuty and ServiceNow, two of the most popular 
incident management platforms in the industry. 

Reports, Capacity Planning, and Chargeback

AppFormix reports enable users to analyze how infrastructure 
resources are consumed over time. Reports may be generated 
over a specified time period and organized by different scopes: 
project, host, department, and so on. In each case, the report 
shows resource utilization for a specific project or scheduled on a 
particular resource device. The dashboard displays reports in both 
graphical or tabular formats. Users may also download report data 
as an HTML-formatted report, raw comma-separated value (CSV) 
file, or JSON-formatted data for further analysis.

Data SheetAppFormixIn many cases, simply knowing the resource consumption is 
not enough. To help administrators accurately plan for the 
future, AppFormix software provides robust capacity planning 
functionality that gives operators a simple, precise view of the 
infrastructure’s current resource configurations, used resources, 
and available resources as well as usage patterns. Based on 
this valuable data, administrators can make informed decisions 
regarding capacity expansion, resource re-allocation, or both. 

Specifications
AppFormix components can operate on any physical or virtual 
compute resources. For the most up-to-date AppFormix 
installation and resource requirements, please refer to the

For those who need to seamlessly integrate cloud infrastructure 
with one’s existing business support system (BSS), or are 
simply looking to implement a new one, AppFormix provides a 
chargeback feature that allows operators to set prices for the 
compute, network, and storage resources offered within the 
infrastructure. AppFormix software calculates the cost based 
on resource usage and presents the costs in reports and cost 
forecasts. Operators can configure cost-sharing among different 
organizational entities (e.g., departments).
