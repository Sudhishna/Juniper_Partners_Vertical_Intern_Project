EX2300 Ethernet Switch

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks EX2300 
Ethernet Switch offers an 
economical, entry-level, 
standalone solution for access-
layer deployments in branch 
and remote offices, as well as 
enterprise campus networks.

To simplify network operations, 
the EX2300 is hardware-ready to 
act as a satellite device to support 
a Juniper Networks Junos Fusion 
Enterprise deployment, which can 
combine several wiring closets 
into one logical management 
platform. For smaller networks, up 
to four EX2300 switches can be 
interconnected in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration, allowing them to be 
managed as a single switch.

Product Description  
The Juniper Networks® EX2300 line of Ethernet switches offers a compact, high-
performance solution for supporting today’s converged network access deployments.

Each EX2300 switch includes an ASIC-based Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) with an 
integrated CPU to consistently deliver wire-rate forwarding, even with all control plane 
features enabled. Based on existing, field-proven Juniper Networks technology, the PFE 
brings the same level of carrier-class performance and reliability to the EX2300 switches 
that Juniper Networks routers bring to the world’s largest service provider networks.

Select EX2300 models also support the 802.3af Class 3 Power over Ethernet (PoE) and 
802.3at PoE+ standards for supporting networked devices such as telephones, video 
cameras, IEEE 802.11ac WLAN access points, and videophones in converged networks. The 
PoE-enabled EX2300 switches include a maximum system budget of 740 watts to deliver 
up to 30 watts to select ports.

Architecture and Key Components
The EX2300 occupies a single rack unit, delivering a compact 
solution for crowded wiring closets and access locations where 
space and power are at a premium. The EX2300 switch’s 
10-inch/12-inch depth and low acoustics also make it ideal for 
open office deployments. For silent operation requirements, please 
see the EX2300-C, a compact, fanless version of the EX2300.

Each EX2300 switch supports four fixed front-panel 1GbE/10GbE 
uplink ports with pluggable optics (purchased separately) for 
high-speed backbone or link aggregation connections between 
wiring closets and upstream aggregation switches. The EX2300 
also features a front-panel mode button that offers a simple 
interface for bringing devices up and selecting LED modes.

A dedicated rear panel RJ-45 Ethernet port is available for out-
of-band management, while a rear panel USB port can be used 
to easily upload the Junos OS and configuration files.

Junos Fusion Enterprise Technology

Juniper Networks Junos Fusion Enterprise technology provides 
automated network configuration and simplifies scalability for 
medium to large enterprise networks. Using Juniper Networks 
EX9200 line of programmable switches as aggregation devices 
and EX2300 switches as satellite nodes, Junos Fusion Enterprise 
technology can be deployed across a building (or multiple 
buildings) to connect large numbers of switches in a fabric that 
can be managed as a single device. 

EX9200 Aggregation Devices

EX2300 Satellite Devices

Figure 1:  Junos Fusion Enterprise deployment using EX2300 

switches as satellite devices

With Junos Fusion technology, enterprises can reduce network 
complexity and operational costs by collapsing underlying 
network elements into a single logical point of control from 
Junos OS-based Juniper routing and switching platforms. It is 
designed for customers who need to cost-effectively deploy 
numerous switch ports throughout their enterprise campus 
network and manage them all from a central device. In addition, 
existing EX2300 switches can be easily added to a Junos Fusion 
Enterprise deployment with a simple software upgrade, offering 
full investment protection. 

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices do not 
require to be individually connected to aggregation devices. Up 
to 10 satellite devices can be interconnected via standard 10GbE 
interfaces to form a “cluster,” which in turn can be connected to 
the aggregation device(s) over a pair of fiber uplinks. Satellite 
devices or clusters can also be dual-homed or single-homed to 
the aggregation devices. 

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices forward all 
traffic to the aggregation device, enabling network administrators 
to monitor and manage the entire enterprise campus building from 
a single device. Features such as PoE/PoE+, LLDP-MED, and 802.1x 
are also supported in Junos Fusion Enterprise architectures to help 
meet enterprise campus requirements.

Virtual Chassis Technology

The EX2300 supports Juniper’s unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, enabling up to four interconnected EX2300 switches 
to be managed as a single logical device, delivering a scalable, 
pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding network environments. 

While EX2300 switches can be interconnected over any of the 
front-panel uplink ports using standard 10GbE SFP+ transceivers 
(sold separately), these ports can also be configured as 
1GbE/10GbE uplinks to aggregation devices by disabling the 
Virtual Chassis technology.

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2300 
switches elect a primary and a backup switch based on a 
set of preconfigured policies or criteria. The primary switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all other Virtual Chassis switch members. 
Switches can be added to or removed from the Virtual Chassis 
configuration without service disruption. 

2

Data SheetEX2300 Ethernet SwitchEX2300 Virtual Chassis configurations operate as highly resilient 
unified systems, providing simplified management using a single 
IP address, single telnet session, single command-line interface 
(CLI), automatic version checking, and automatic configuration. 
The EX2300 switches are also capable of local switching, so 
packets coming into a port destined for another port on the same 
switch do not have to traverse the Virtual Chassis, increasing 
forwarding capacities.

EX2300 Virtual Chassis configurations implement the 
same slot/module/port numbering schema as other Juniper 
Networks chassis-based products, providing true chassis-like 
operations. By using a consistent operating system and a single 
configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration 
are treated as a single device, simplifying overall system 
maintenance and management.

Simplified Management and Operations

Junos Fusion Enterprise technology dramatically simplifies EX2300 
management by enabling a large number of the switches to 
be managed from a single interface when deployed as satellite 
devices. With features such as plug-and-play deployment and 
rolling software upgrades, Junos Fusion Enterprise eliminates the 
need to individually manage every access switch in the enterprise 
network, leading to lower operational costs and overall lower TCO.

Virtual Chassis technology simplifies network management 
for smaller deployments. Up to four interconnected EX2300 
switches can be managed as a single device utilizing a single 
Junos OS image and a single configuration file, reducing the 
overall number of units to monitor and manage. When the Junos 
OS is upgraded on the primary switch in an EX2300 Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the software is automatically upgraded on 
all other member switches at the same time.

The EX2300 includes port profiles that allow network 
administrators to automatically configure ports with security, 

QoS, and other parameters based on the type of device 
connected to the port. Six preconfigured profiles are available, 
including default, desktop, desktop plus IP phone, WLAN access 
point, routed uplink, and Layer 2 uplink. Users can select from 
the existing profiles or create their own and apply them through 
the command-line interface (CLI), J-Web Software interface, or 
management system.

In addition, a feature called system snapshot makes a copy of 
all software files used to run the switch—including the Junos 
operating system, the active configuration, and the rescue 
configuration. These files can be used to reboot the switch at 
the next power-up or as a backup boot option. The Junos OS 
software can also be preinstalled on a flash drive and used to 
boot the EX2300 at any time.

Another feature, called automatic software download, enables 
network administrators to easily upgrade the EX2300 using 
the DHCP message exchange process to download and install 
software packages. Users simply configure the automatic 
software download feature on EX2300 switches acting as DHCP 
clients and establish a path to the server where the software 
package file is installed. The server then communicates the path 
to the software package file through DHCP server messages.

A zero touch provisioning (ZTP) feature allows a DHCP server 
to push configuration details and software images to multiple 
switches at boot-up time.

Two system management options are available for the EX2300 
line. The standard Junos OS CLI management interface offers 
the same granular capabilities and scripting parameters found in 
any router powered by the Junos operating system. The EX2300 
also includes the integrated J-Web interface, an embedded Web-
based device manager that allows users to configure, monitor, 
troubleshoot, and perform system maintenance on individual 
switches via a browser-based graphical interface.

Data SheetEX2300 Ethernet SwitchFeatures and Benefits
High Availability Features

To avoid the complexities of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) 
without sacrificing network resiliency, the EX2300 employs a 
redundant trunk group (RTG) to provide the necessary port 
redundancy and simplify switch configuration. It also supports 
cross-member link aggregation, which allows redundant link 
aggregation connections between devices in a single Virtual 
Chassis configuration, providing an additional level of reliability 
and availability.

Junos Operating System

The EX2300 switches run the same Junos OS that is used by 
other Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, QFX Series 
Switches, Juniper Routers, Juniper SRX Firewalls, and the Juniper 
NFX Series Network Services Platform. By utilizing a common 
operating system, Juniper delivers a consistent implementation 
and operation of control plane features across all products. To 
maintain that consistency, the Junos OS adheres to a highly 
disciplined development process that uses a single source code, 
and it employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression-tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version. Customers can deploy the software with 
complete confidence that all existing capabilities are maintained 
and operate in the same way.

Converged Environments

The EX2300 provides the highest levels of flexibility and features 
in its class for the most demanding converged data, voice, and 
video environments, delivering a reliable platform for unifying 
enterprise communications.

By providing a full 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE to VoIP telephones, 
closed-circuit security cameras, wireless access points, and 
other IP-enabled devices, the EX2300 delivers a future-proofed 
solution for converging disparate networks onto a single IP 
infrastructure. The EX2300 PoE switches also support 802.3at 
standards-based PoE+, delivering 30 watts for powering 
networked devices such as IEEE 802.11ac wireless access points, 
and videophones that might require more power than available 
with IEEE 802.3af.

To ease deployment, the EX2300 supports the industry-standard 
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media Endpoint 
Discovery (LLDP-MED) protocol, enabling the switches to 
automatically discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their 
power requirements, and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) membership. 
LLDP-MED-based granular PoE management allows the EX2300 
to negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on powered 
devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across the switch.

In addition, the EX2300 supports rich quality-of-service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The 
switches support eight class-of-service (CoS) queues on every 
port, enabling them to maintain multilevel, end-to-end traffic 
prioritizations. The EX2300 also supports a wide range of policy 
options, including strict priority, low latency, weighted random 
early detection (WRED), and shaped-deficit weighted round-
robin (SDWRR) queuing.

Security

Working as an enforcement point in Access Policy Infrastructure, 
the EX2300 provides both standards-based 802.1X port-level 
access control for multiple devices per port, as well as Layer 2-4 
policy enforcement based on user identity, location, device, or 
a combination of these. A user’s identity, device type, machine 
posture check, and location can be used to determine whether 
access should be granted and for how long. If access is granted, 
the switch provides access to the network based on authorization 
attributes sent by the authentication server. The switch can also 
apply security policies, QoS policies, or both, or it can mirror 
user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring, or threat 
detection by intrusion prevention systems.

The EX2300 also provides a full complement of integrated 
port security and threat detection features, including Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping, dynamic ARP 
inspection (DAI), and media access control (MAC) limiting to 
defend against internal and external spoofing, and man-in-the-
middle and denial of service (DoS) attacks.

Junos Space
Juniper also offers a comprehensive suite of network 
management tools that provide a smart, simple, and open 
approach for automating the deployment and operation of a 
Juniper infrastructure.

These tools are based on a single network application platform 
called Juniper Networks Junos Space, an open, programmable 
application platform for hosting network infrastructure and 
operational applications across the entire management life 
cycle of the network. Explicitly designed to allow partners and 
customers to build and deploy smart, simple, and easy-to-
use applications, Junos Space provides multiple management 
and infrastructure applications for managing Juniper resources 
and assets, including inventory management, device and 
interface configuration, automated software management 
and deployment, and event-driven fault management. These 
platform applications are embedded within the core product, 
allowing users to control any part of their environment when 
used in conjunction with multiple add-on applications. Junos 
Space supports a full portfolio of applications for automating 
network infrastructure and operations covering the campus LAN 
and data center network environments.

Data SheetEX2300 Ethernet SwitchDesigned to automate the configuration, visualization, monitoring, 
and administration of large switch and router networks, these 
Junos Space applications offer predefined automation schemes 
and best practice templates to enable rapid and accurate 
deployments. When managing a group of EX2300 switches, 
the Junos Space platform and associated applications provide 
network-level management across all Juniper Networks switches 
from a single console.

Network Director can manage the EX2300 as standalone switches 
as well as satellite devices in a Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric.
