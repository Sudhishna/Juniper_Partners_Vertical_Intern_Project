OCX1100 Open  
Networking Switch

Product Overview

Large-scale cloud-based data 
centers require a new set of 
networking capabilities that set 
them apart from traditional IT 
data centers. With the help of 
organizations such as the Open 
Compute Project (OCP), a new 
breed of switching platform 
is emerging based on these 
minimalistic design requirements.

Juniper Networks OCX1100 is an 
open networking switch based 
on hardware specifications 
ratified by the OCP. Combining a 
cloud-optimized OCP-submitted 
hardware design with the 
industry-proven and feature-rich 
Juniper Networks Junos operating 
system, the OCX1100 gives 
customers all of the benefits of 
an open source hardware design 
with none of the compromises.

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® OCX1100 open networking switch is designed for large Cloud 
Builders looking to capitalize on innovations derived from real-world, massive scale, data 
center customer environments and backed by the industry recognized Open Compute 
Project (OCP) Foundation.

Running the hardened, carrier-class Juniper Networks Junos® operating system, the OCX1100 
combines the power, performance, and reliability of a proven network OS with cloud-
optimized, open source switching hardware built on commercially sourced components. 

The OCX1100 is based on OCP-submitted design specifications, ensuring that customers 
are leveraging a consistent and open hardware platform. By offering a single source 
solution, the OCX1100 offers customers the economies of an open hardware design while 
providing a level of software features, support, and reliability not typically available with 
other white box solutions.

Architecture and Key Components
The OCX1100 offers 48 small form-factor pluggable and pluggable plus (SFP/ SFP+) 
transceiver ports and six quad SFP+ (QSFP+) ports in a compact 1 U platform. It is 
designed for Cloud Builders who want an open source hardware platform but won’t 
compromise on performance, reliability, or support. Featuring an aggregate throughput of 
1.44 Tbps per switch, the OCX1100 is an ideal high-density top-of-rack solution for large-
scale IP Fabric deployments.

Junos OS

The OCX1100 switch runs Junos OS, Juniper’s feature-rich, 
powerful, and robust network operating system. The following 
key Junos OS features enhance the functionality and capabilities 
of the OCX1100: 

•  A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 

reporting, and resolution

•  Rich automation capabilities that address the need for more 

automation and programmability in large data centers, 
including support for Python, Chef, Puppet, and zero-touch 
provisioning (ZTP)

•  Commit and rollback functionality that ensures error-free 

network configurations

•  Software modularity, with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and the 
ability to do process restarts

The OCX1100 is ideal for top-of-rack Layer 3 deployments. It 
supports 48 ports of native 10GbE for server connectivity and up 
to six 40GbE ports for uplink connectivity, providing very low 2:1 
oversubscription from access to aggregation.  Each 40GbE port 
can also be broken out into four 10GbE ports, providing additional 
options for server connectivity. 

Running the Junos OS, which features the most advanced and 
robust routing capabilities in the industry, the OCX1100 includes 
support for RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP for both IPv4 and IPv6 
in the base software. With additional capabilities like 64-way 
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) and BGP add path, the OCX1100 is 
an optimized building block for deploying IP fabrics (see Figure 1)1.

OCX1100 Switch Benefits

•  Cloud-optimized solution: The OCX1100 offers a cost-

effective, open source switching solution for large-scale cloud 
deployments that value the simplicity and reliability of the 
carrier-class Junos operating system. 

•  Open architecture: The OCX1100 is based on OCP-

submitted design specifications, allowing customers to 
leverage the open source hardware design community.

•  Superior reliability: Combining the carrier-class Junos 

operating system with an open source hardware architecture, 
the OCX1100 delivers a highly reliable, cost-effective 
switching solution. 

•  Consistent operating environment: Running Junos OS on 

the cloud-optimized OCX1100 switch lowers the learning 
curve for customers who already use Juniper switches, 
routers, or security appliances in other parts of their network.

•  A rich set of Layer 3 features for IPv4 and IPv6 deployments, 

including BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP add path (see the 
Software Features section for a detailed list)

• 

Investment protection: Compatible with Juniper Networks 
QFX5100 Ethernet Switches, the OCX1100 can be easily 
deployed in existing Juniper network environments.
