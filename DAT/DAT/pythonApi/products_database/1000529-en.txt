Architecture and Key Components
The QFX10000 modular data center spine and core Ethernet 
switches share a number of architectural elements. The Control 
Boards (CBs) employed by these switches run Junos OS, which 
processes all Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols, while the Switch 
Fabric modules manage the chassis and provide switching 
functionality for data traffic coming from line cards.

The QFX10000 line cards, which are common across all modular 
QFX10000 platforms, include Packet Forwarding Engines (PFEs) 
that process network traffic, as well as a line-card processor that 
provides scalable local control. 

The QFX10000 Virtual Output Queue (VOQ)-based architecture 
is designed to scale to very large deployments, with no head-
of-line blocking, a single-tier low-latency switch fabric, efficient 
multicast replication handling, and deep buffering to ensure 
performance at scale. The horizontal line cards in the front of the 
chassis directly connect with the vertical switch fabric cards in 
the rear of the chassis via orthogonal interconnects, without the 
need for a midplane. This midplane-less architecture ensures a 
smooth upgrade process to higher-speed switch fabric cards in the 

Each QFX10000 line card is unique in its ability to support 
tri-speed 10GbE, 40GbE and 100GbE connections, enabling 
customers to transition seamlessly from one speed to another 
as their needs change. The unprecedented port density, high 
logical table sizes and up to 100ms deep packet buffers allow 
customers to deploy the most scalable systems necessary to 
meet the exponential data growth in the data center. 

Each QFX10000 line card is built upon the Juniper Q5 silicon, 
which supports a wide range of Layer 2 and Layer 3 Ethernet 
functionality including 802.1Q VLAN, VXLAN, link aggregation, 
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), L2 to L3 mapping, 
and port monitoring. Additionally, the line cards support filtering, 
sampling, load balancing, rate limiting, class of service (CoS), 
MPLS, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit functionality, 
and other key features needed to deploy a dependable, lossless, 
high-performance Ethernet infrastructure.

QFX10000 Control Board

The QFX10000 Control Board supports control and management 
plane functionality with an integrated Routing Engine (RE) that 
features a quad-core, 2.5 GHz Intel processor with 32 gigabytes of 
SDRAM and an on-board solid-state drive (SSD) providing 32 GB 
of storage for Junos OS images and logs. The CB also has a front 
SSD slot to support a hot swappable SSD for secondary images 
and other external storage. The CB features AUX, console, and 
Ethernet ports on the front panel to support out-of-band system 
management and monitoring, while an external USB port provides 
a removable media interface to install Junos OS images manually. 

The CB’s central CPU performs all system control functions and 
maintains hardware forwarding table and routing protocol states 
for the QFX10000 modular switches. Dedicated hardware on 
the CB module supports chassis management functions such 
as environmental monitoring, while communication between CB 
modules and individual line cards takes place over a dedicated 
internal 10GbE out-of-band control interface.

Data SheetQFX10000 Modular Ethernet SwitchesQFX10000 Switch Fabric

The QFX10000 Switch Fabric modules are hot-swappable 
and serve as the central non-blocking matrix through which all 
network data passes. 

Both the QFX10008 and QFX10016 systems have six Switch 
Fabric cards that provide N+1 redundancy. The Switch Fabric 
cards deliver 7.2 Tbps throughput per slot. The switch cards 
can be upgraded to provide more than 200 Tbps of system 
throughput in the future. 

Switch Fabric modules perform the following key functions:

•  Monitor and control system functions

• 

Interconnect all line cards

•  Handle clock and system resets

Power

The QFX10008 contains six power supply bays while the 
QFX10016 has ten power supply bays to provide complete 
flexibility for provisioning and redundancy. Each power supply has 
its own internal fan for cooling. All QFX10000 chassis support 
both AC and DC power supplies; however, AC and DC supplies 
cannot be mixed in the same chassis.

The AC supplies on the QFX10008 chassis accept 200 to 240 
volts alternating current (VAC) input and deliver 2,700 watts of 
power to the chassis, while the DC power supplies accept -40 
to -72 volts direct current (VDC) input and deliver 2,500 watts 
of power to the chassis. Each AC and DC power supply has two 
inputs for feed redundancy.

Cooling

The QFX10000 modular chassis support front-to-back cooling 
with air being pulled in through the perforations on the Control 
Boards and the line cards in the front of the chassis. Hot air is 
exhausted through the fan trays that are placed in front of the 
fabric cards in the rear of the chassis as well as through the 
power supplies.

Each chassis hosts two fan tray subsystems with redundant fans. 
Each fan tray subsystem consists of a fan tray controller and a 
fan tray. The fan tray controller provides power to the fan trays 
and manages the fans in the fan tray.

Flexible Network Architectures

The QFX10000 switches support a diverse set of deployment 
options, including Layer 3 fabric and Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks 
with Juniper multichassis link aggregation group (MC-LAG). 
Customers can choose the architecture that best suits their 
deployment needs and easily adapt and evolve as requirements 
change over time. The QFX10000 switches serve as the universal 
building block for all of these switching architectures, enabling 
data center operators to build cloud networks their way.

Layer 3 Fabric: For customers looking to build scale-out 
data centers, a Layer 3 spine and leaf Clos Fabric is ideal due 
to its non-blocking and predictable performance and scale 
characteristics. As an example, a two-tier fabric with the 
QFX10000 switches as the spine and QFX5100 switches as leafs 
can scale to support more than 50,000 10GbE server ports at 3:1 
oversubscription. 

One of the most complicated tasks in building an IP fabric 
is assigning all of the details such as IP addresses, BGP AS 
numbers, routing policy, loopback addresses, and many other 
implementation details. Automating the creation of an IP fabric 
at a large scale is also difficult. Juniper has created the OpenClos 
project to provide free, open-source tools to automate the 
creation of IP fabrics in the data center. OpenClos is a set of 
Python scripts developed as an open-source project that live 
on GitHub.  OpenClos takes a set of inputs that describe the 
shape and size of a data center and outputs network switch 
configuration files and even a cabling plan. 

Juniper MC-LAG: The QFX10000 switches also eliminate 
Spanning Tree Protocol in traditional Layer 2 networks when 
deployed in a MC-LAG configuration. The active-active operation 
of MC-LAG ensures complete bandwidth utilization between the 
network’s access and aggregation layers, while the dual control 
plane technology ensures highest availability for applications. 

Overlays: Customers can deploy overlay networks to provide 
Layer 2 adjacencies for applications over Layer 3 fabrics. The 
overlay networks use VXLAN in the data plane and EVPN or 
OVSDB for programming the overlays.  The overlays can operate 
without a controller, or can be orchestrated with an SDN 
controller like OpenContrail or VMware NSX. 

Carrier-Class Operating System
The QFX10000 line of switches runs the same Junos OS used 
by all other Juniper Networks EX Series and QFX Series Ethernet 
Switches, as well as the Juniper Networks routers that power the 
world’s largest and most complex networks.

By using a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. Junos OS employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system. Key Junos OS features that enhance the 
functionality and capabilities of the QXF10000 include:

•  Software modularity, with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and 
with the ability to do process restarts

•  Uninterrupted routing and forwarding with features such as 

nonstop routing (NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB)

•  Commit and rollback functionality that ensures error-free 

network configurations

• 

 A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 
reporting, and resolution

Juniper Virtualized Open Network Operating  
System Framework

The QFX10000 switches have an open software architecture 
that enables customers to innovate along with Juniper to 
accelerate the pace of innovation. Customers can create and run 
applications alongside Junos; these applications can then follow 
their own software release schedule.

For cloud deployments, Network Director provides a set of REST 
APIs that enable on-demand and dynamic network services 
by simplifying the consumption of services for multitenant 
environments. With third-party cloud orchestration tool 
integration, the Network Director API enables automation and 
provisioning of Layer 2, Layer 3, and security services in the data 
center without the need for manual operator intervention.

This new solution offers modularity and direct programmability 
through APIs. The platform and Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) 
modules are separate from the control module(s). Customers 
can create and run guest applications, either as a VM or a Linux 
daemon, alongside Junos and communicate with Junos and 
also directly with platform and PFE modules through normalized 
programmable APIs.  Having the ability to build applications that 
can program the QFX10000 control plane, data plane and the 
platform itself, the customers can implement specific and unique 
network forwarding functions and automate the control and 
management by integrating with the customer’s SDN controller 
and orchestration tools. The Juniper QFX10000 programmable 
APIs have a stable abstraction so that the customer applications 
can work across Juniper platforms as well as future Junos 
releases. Based on Apache Thrift, the Juniper QFX10000 
supports standardized API definition via Interface Description 
Language (IDL) while allowing the use of customer’s favorite 
programming language.

Other services such as analytics and automation can also run 
as separate daemons and can be directly accessed through 
orchestration tools. 

Junos Space Network Director 

The QFX10000 switches can be managed through Junos Space 
Network Director, a next-generation network management 
solution that allows users to visualize, analyze, and control the 
entire enterprise network—data center and campus, physical 
and virtual—through a single pane of glass. Network Director 
incorporates sophisticated analytics for real-time intelligence, 
trended monitoring, and automation to increase agility as well as 
faster rollout and activation of services.

Features and Benefits
High Availability

QFX10000 modular spine and core switches deliver a number of 
high availability features that ensure uninterrupted, carrier-class 
performance. Each QFX10000 chassis includes an extra slot to 
accommodate a redundant RE module that serves as a backup 
in hot-standby mode, ready to take over in the event of a master 
RE failure. If the master fails, the integrated Layer 2 and Layer 3 
graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) feature of Junos OS, 
working in conjunction with the nonstop active routing (NSR) and 
nonstop bridging (NSB) features, ensures a seamless transfer 
of control to the backup, maintaining uninterrupted access to 
applications, services, and IP communications. 

Virtual Output Queue (VOQ) 

The QFX10000 switches support a virtual output queue (VOQ)-
based architecture designed for very large deployments. VOQ refers 
to a queue on the egress port that is maintained by the ingress PFE. 
With VOQ architecture, packets are queued and dropped on ingress 
during congestion with no head-of-line blocking.

Automation

The QFX10000 switches support a number of features for network 
automation and plug-and-play operations. Features include 
operations and event scripts, automatic rollback, and Python 
scripting. The switches can also support integration with VMware 
NSX, OpenContrail, Puppet, OpenStack, and CloudStack. 

MPLS

QFX10000 switches support a broad set of MPLS features, 
including L3 VPN, IPv6 provider edge router (6PE, 6VPE), RSVP 
traffic engineering, and LDP to allow standards-based network 
segmentation and virtualization.

VXLAN

The QFX10000 supports Layer 2 and Layer 3 gateway services 
that enable VXLAN-to-VLAN connectivity at any tier of the data 
center network, from server access to the edge. The QFX10000 
can integrate with NSX through data plane (VXLAN) and 
control and management plane (OVSDB) protocols to centrally 
automate and orchestrate the data center network.

FCoE

As Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switches, the 
QFX10000 line provides an IEEE data center bridging (DCB) 
converged network between FCoE-enabled servers and an 
FCoE-enabled Fibre Channel storage area network (SAN). The 
QFX10000 offers a full-featured DCB implementation that 
provides strong monitoring capabilities, helping SAN and LAN 
administration teams maintain clear management separation.  

The FCoE transit switch functionality, including priority-based 
flow control (PFC) and Data Center Bridging Capability Exchange 
(DCBX), are included as part of the default software.
