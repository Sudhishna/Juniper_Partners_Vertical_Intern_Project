EX Series Redundant
Power System 

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks EX Series 
Ethernet Switches redundant 
power system (RPS) acts as 
a backup device that provides 
redundant power to up to six 
connected Juniper Networks 
EX2200 and EX3300 Ethernet 
Switches, with or without Power 
over Ethernet (PoE). The RPS 
ensures operational continuity 
following a main power supply 
or power feed failure, and can be 
easily managed and configured 
from the command-line interface 
of any connected EX Series switch.

Product Description
The Juniper Networks® EX Series Ethernet Switches redundant power system (RPS) 
provides backup power to connected Juniper Networks EX2200 and EX3300 Ethernet 
Switches, ensuring operational continuity in the event of a main power supply or power 
feed failure.

Features and Benefits
The EX Series RPS supports a number of key features, including the following:

•  Connects to up to six switches: The EX Series RPS can be connected to a maximum of 

six switches (any combination of EX2200 and EX3300s) using RPS switch connectors.

•  Supports three power supplies: An EX Series RPS can accommodate up to three hot-
insertable, hot-removable, field-replaceable power supplies. All three power supplies 
must be the same type, and currently only the EX-PWR3-930-AC power supply is 
supported. Mixing different types of power supplies is not supported. 

•  Provides backup power to three switches simultaneously: The EX Series RPS can 

power up to three switches simultaneously (out of a total of six switches connected to 
the RPS) when all three power supplies are installed. 

•  Protection: The EX Series RPS provides integral protection against high-voltage input 

and output, as well as against short circuits.

•  Configurable switch priority: The EX Series RPS operates in parallel with the main 

power supplies of the connected switches, providing backup power based on the 
connected switches’ configured priority and port number. By default, all switches share 
the same priority and precedence is based on connector position. Switch priorities can 
be reconfigured from the switch command-line interface (CLI) to supersede priority 
based on connector position. In the event of a power feed failure on a connected 
switch, the EX Series RPS automatically senses the switch’s power needs (PoE or 
non-PoE) and delivers adequate uninterrupted power to the switch with no switch 
reboot required. When the switch’s internal power is restored, the EX Series RPS stops 
supplying power to that switch and instead delivers power to any other switches that 
require backup power, based on their configured priority.

•  Multi-backup capability: A single power supply in the EX Series RPS can actively power 

up to two non-PoE switches or one PoE-enabled switch.

•  19-inch mounting: The EX Series RPS can be mounted on a 19-inch equipment rack or 
cabinet using mounting brackets. The EX Series RPS can also be mounted in the same 
rack or cabinet as the supported switches.

•  Easy management: The EX Series RPS is managed and configured from the CLI of any 

connected EX Series switch.

Data SheetDeployment with EX3300 Switch with Vir-
tual Chassis Technology
The EX3300 Ethernet Switch supports Juniper Networks Virtual 
Chassis technology, which enables up to six EX3300 switches to 
be interconnected using Virtual Chassis Extensions (VCEs) over 
uplink ports. With Virtual Chassis technology, the interconnected 
switches behave like a single, logical device, delivering a scalable, 
pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding network environments. 

The EX Series RPS can be used along with other redundant 
power systems to provide redundant power to an entire EX3300 
Virtual Chassis configuration with six members.

The EX Series RPS offers flexible rack mounting options and can 
be deployed facing either the power supplies or the front-panel 
ports of the connected switches.

Figure 2: EX Series RPS deployed with EX3300 and  

EX2200 switches

Deployment Scenarios
EX3300 switches can be deployed either with a single power feed 
providing electricity to both the switch and the EX Series RPS, 
or with a dual power feed. In the second case, one power feed is 
connected to the switch and a separate power feed is connected 
to the EX Series RPS. If the EX3300 switch and the EX Series RPS 
have separate power feeds, the EX Series RPS will supply power in 
two ways. If the built-in power supply fails, the EX Series RPS will 
provide power until the switch can be replaced. If the electricity 
fails, the EX Series RPS will provide power until electricity is 
restored to the switch and the switch once again uses its internal 
power supply.

When the EX Series RPS is used for EX2200 backup, the switch 
and RPS can be deployed only with a single power feed (source 
of electricity). If the built-in power supply fails, the EX Series RPS 
will provide power until the switch can be replaced.
