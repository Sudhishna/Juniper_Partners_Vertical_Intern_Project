Product Overview

The Juniper Networks Compact 
EX2200-C Ethernet Switch offers 
an economical, entry level, simply 
connected solution in a compact, 
fanless form factor for access 
layer deployments in micro-
branches, retail, and workgroup 
environments. 

The EX2200 also supports 
Juniper Networks Virtual Chassis 
technology, allowing up to four 
interconnected switches to be 
managed as a single logical 
device, delivering a scalable, 
pay-as-you-grow solution for 
expanding networks.

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® EX2200-C Ethernet Switch with Virtual Chassis technology delivers 
a compact, silent, and power efficient platform for low-density micro branch deployments 
and commercial access or enterprise workgroup environments outside the wiring closet.

Featuring 12 10/100/1000BASE-T access ports with and without Power over Ethernet 
Plus (PoE+) in a fanless design, the EX2200-C switches deliver a powerful solution for 
supporting services such as unified communications, IP telephony, closed circuit television 
(CCTV), and other applications in office, classroom, hospitality, and other space and 
wiring constrained environments. Two front panel, dual-purpose (10/100/1000BASE-T or 
100/1000BASE-X) uplinks provide operational flexibility. 

Architecture and Key Components
The fixed configuration EX2200 line of Ethernet switches delivers complete Layer 2 and 
basic Layer 3 switching capabilities to satisfy the low-density branch and low-density 
wiring closet connectivity requirements of today’s high-performance businesses. The 
EX2200-C models extend that reach into workgroup environments that reside outside 
the wiring closet, including micro branch offices, retail access applications, education, 
hospitality, and other locations where the switch is deployed in open areas.

Two models are available. The EX2200-C-12T-2G offers 12 front panel 10/100/1000BASE-T 
ports for connecting to networked devices. The EX2200-C-12P-2G includes support for 
the IEEE 802.3at PoE+ standard for powering networked devices such as telephones, 
video cameras, multiple radio IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN (WLAN) access points, and video 
phones in converged network environments.

The EX2200-C switches also include two front panel, small form-factor pluggable 
transceiver (SFP) GbE uplink ports, and two RJ-45 copper GbE uplink ports. Up to two of 
the uplink ports can be used simultaneously, providing the flexibility to connect to higher 
layer devices such as aggregation switches or routers over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) 
or fiber optic cabling. The uplink ports can also be configured as Virtual Chassis interfaces 
and connected via standard GbE optics interfaces; the last two are preconfigured by 
default as Virtual Chassis ports. A fixed internal power supply ensures operational 
simplicity.

Virtual Chassis Technology
The EX2200-C supports Juniper’s unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, enabling up to four interconnected EX2200-C 
switches to be managed as a single logical device and delivering 
a scalable, pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding network 
environments. 

While EX2200-C switches can be interconnected over any of 
the front-panel uplink ports, the last two ports are configured by 
default as Virtual Chassis ports, automating deployments when 
using standard GbE SFP transceivers (sold separately). These 
two ports can also be configured as GbE uplinks to aggregation 
devices by disabling the Virtual Chassis technology.

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2200-C 
switches elect a master and a backup switch based on a 
set of preconfigured policies or criteria. The master switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all other Virtual Chassis switch members.  
Switches can be added to or removed from the Virtual Chassis 
configuration without service disruption. 

EX2200-C Virtual Chassis configurations operate as highly 
resilient unified systems, providing simplified management using 
a single IP address, single telnet session, single command-line 
interface (CLI), automatic version checking, and automatic 
configuration. The EX2200-C switches are also capable of local 
switching, so packets coming into a port destined for another 
port on the same switch do not have to traverse the Virtual 
Chassis, increasing forwarding capacities.

EX2200-C Virtual Chassis configurations implement the same 
slot/module/port numbering schema as other Juniper Networks 
chassis-based products, providing true chassis-like operations. 
By using a consistent operating system and a single configuration 
file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration are treated 
as a single device, simplifying overall system maintenance and 
management.

Data SheetCompact EX2200-C Ethernet SwitchFeatures and Benefits
The EX2200-C model switches include a number of features that 
make them ideal for low-density, open space deployments.

Compact Form Factor

At 10.6 inches wide and 9.4 inches deep, EX2200-C switches 
can be easily and discreetly installed on desktops, on or under 
shelves, or on walls. An optional magnetic mounting pad is 
available for securing the EX2200-C switches to metal surfaces. 
Rack mount kits are also available for installing the switches in 
standard 19 inch wiring racks. Wall mounting can be done using 
the flexible mounting slots on the bottom of the chassis to fix to 
the screws on the wall.

Dual-Purpose Uplinks

Two front panel, dual-purpose (10/100/1000BASE-T or 
100/1000BASE-X) uplinks provide operational flexibility.

Silent Operation

The air-cooled EX2200-C switches do not require internal fans, 
resulting in a silent operating mode suitable for deployments 
in workgroup areas. The fanless design also reduces power 
consumption and improves mean time between failures (MTBF) 
by eliminating moving parts that can fail.

Low Power Consumption

The lack of an internal fan reduces the power consumed by the 
EX2200-C switches. The hardware has Energy Efficient Ethernet 
(EEE)-capable ports (with software support available in a 
future release), providing low power consumption when network 
link is idle.

Simplified Operations

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2200-C 
dramatically simplifies network management.  Up to four 
interconnected EX2200-C switches can be managed as a 
single device utilizing a single Junos OS image file and a single 
configuration file, reducing the overall number of units to 
monitor and manage. When the Junos OS is upgraded on the 
master switch in an EX2200-C Virtual Chassis configuration, 
the software is automatically upgraded on all other member 
switches at the same time.

Dedicated front panel RJ-45 and USB console ports offer flexible 
out-of-band management options, while a front panel USB 
port can be used to easily upload the Juniper Networks Junos® 
operating system and configuration files. A series of front panel 
LEDs offer system status information with a button that allows 
users to toggle through four different modes for reporting link 
status, link activity, PoE, and speed. A fixed internal power supply 
ensures operational simplicity.

Easy Provisioning

Auto-configuration and Auto-Image Install features allow the 
switches to be configured and imaged over the network using the 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) message exchange 
process. These features eliminate the need to stage devices prior 
to deployment, dramatically reducing operational expenses. 
Auto-configuration and Auto Image Install allow new branches 
and retail stores to rapidly deploy their networks, and also enable 
software upgrades and security fixes to be performed at the 
touch of a button. An EZ touchless provisioning feature allows a 
DHCP server to push configuration details and software images 
to multiple switches at bootup.

Access Security

The EX2200-C switches fully interoperate with Juniper Networks 
Unified Access Control, which consolidates all aspects of a user’s 
identity, device, and location, enabling administrators to enforce 
access control and security down to the individual port or user 
levels. Working as an enforcement point within the UAC, the 
EX2200-C provides standards-based 802.1X port-level access 
control as well as L2-L4 policy enforcement based on user 
identity, location, and/or device. If access is granted, the switch 
assigns the user to a specific VLAN based on authorization levels. 

The EX2200-C also provides a full complement of port security 
features, including DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection 
(DAI), and media access control (MAC) limiting to defend against 
internal and external spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial-
of-service (DoS) attacks. 

Video and VoIP Ready

The EX2200-C delivers a reliable platform for unifying enterprise 
communication by providing the highest levels of flexibility and 
features in its class for the most demanding converged data, 
voice, and video environments. The EX2200-C switches support 
plug-and-play deployment with industry-standard Link Layer 
Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media Endpoint Discovery 
(LLDP-MED). LLDP-MED-based granular PoE management 
allows the EX2200-C switches to negotiate PoE usage down to 
a fraction of a watt on powered devices, enabling more efficient 
PoE utilization across the switch. 

In addition, the EX2200-C supports rich quality-of-service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The 
switches support eight class-of-service (CoS) queues on every 
port, enabling them to maintain multilevel, end-to-end traffic 
prioritizations. The EX2200-C also supports a wide range of policy 
options, including strict priority, low latency, and shaped deficit 
weighted round-robin (SDWRR) queuing.

Data SheetCompact EX2200-C Ethernet SwitchEasy Cable Management

A cable guard that affixes to the front of the switch holds 
attached cables in place and prevents them from being 
accidentally unplugged or otherwise removed.

Physical Security

Security slots on either side of the switch accept locking devices 
that physically secure switches, preventing them from being 
easily removed in open space or unsecured environments

PoE/PoE+ Power Budget

The EX2200-C-12P-2G switch supports the IEEE 802.3af PoE 
standard, as well as IEEE 802.3at PoE+. The 802.3af standard 
delivers up to 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE per port, while the 
802.3at PoE+ delivers up to 30 watts of power per port for 
supporting networked devices such as telephones, video 
cameras, IEEE 802.11n WLAN access points, and video phones 
that require more than 15.4 watts.

Uplink Ports

With a total PoE system budget of 100 watts, the 12-port EX2200-
C-12P-2G can provide the full 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE to a 
maximum of six ports simultaneously, and the full 30 watts of PoE+ 
to a maximum of three ports simultaneously. Attached devices 
draw the necessary power until the PoE power budget is exhausted.

Junos Operating System

The EX2200-C switches run the same Junos OS that is used 
by other Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well 
as Juniper routers and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services 
Gateways. By using a common operating system, Juniper delivers 
a consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products.
