Virtual Chassis Technology
The EX3300 supports Juniper Networks Virtual Chassis 
technology, allowing up to 10 switches to be interconnected 
over uplink ports and be managed as a single logical device, 
delivering a scalable, pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding 
network environments. 

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX3300 
switches elect a master and backup switch based on a 
set of criteria or preconfigured policies. The master switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all switches in the Virtual Chassis configuration. 
Virtual Chassis technology allows switches to be added or 
removed without service disruption. An EX3300 Virtual Chassis 
configuration operates as a highly resilient unified system, 
providing simplified management using a single IP address, 
single telnet session, single command-line interface (CLI), 
automatic version checking, and automatic configuration. The 
EX3300 switches are also capable of local switching, so that 
packets coming into a port destined for another port on the same 
switch do not have to traverse the Virtual Chassis, increasing the 
forwarding capacity of the switch.

The EX3300 implements the same slot/module/port numbering 
schema as other Juniper Networks chassis-based products 
when numbering Virtual Chassis ports, providing true chassis-like 
operations. By using a consistent operating system and a single 
configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration 
are treated as a single device, simplifying overall system 
maintenance and management.

Figure 1:  EX3300 Virtual Chassis connections

The last two uplink ports on the EX3300 front panel are 
configured by default as Virtual Chassis ports, automating Virtual 
Chassis deployments when these ports are connected using 

standard 10GbE SFP+ or GbE SFP transceivers (sold separately). 
These two ports can also be configured as GbE or 10GbE uplinks 
to aggregation devices by disabling Virtual Chassis technology.

Converged LAN Environments
The EX3300 switches provide a flexible solution for demanding 
converged data, voice, and video environments. The EX3300-24P 
and EX3300-48P support the IEEE 802.3at Power over Ethernet 
(PoE) standard, also known as PoE+, delivering up to 30 watts of 
power per port to support networked devices such as telephones, 
video cameras, IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN (WLAN) access points, 
and video phones. The PoE+ standard provides nearly double the 
15.4 watts per port available with the IEEE 802.3af PoE standard.

The EX3300-48P includes a total PoE power budget of 740 
watts, enabling the switch to provide the full 15.4 watts of 
802.3af Class 3 PoE to all 48 ports, or the full 30 watts of PoE+ 
to 24 ports. The switch can support any combination of PoE and 
PoE+ ports until the maximum PoE power budget of 740 watts is 
exhausted.  

The EX3300-24P includes a total power budget of 405 watts, 
enabling the switch to provide the full 15.4 watts of PoE power to 
all 24 ports, or the full 30 watts of PoE+ to 13 attached devices. 
The switch can support any combination of PoE and PoE+ ports 
until the maximum PoE power budget of 405 watts is exhausted.

There are two PoE power mode settings on the EX3300 switches:

EX8208

EX8208

•  Static mode, which allows customers to specify the 

maximum PoE power setting on an individual port

•  Class mode, which allows end devices to specify PoE class 
and negotiate whether the switch can provide PoE power to 
the device

The EX3300 also supports the industry-standard Link Layer 
Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media Endpoint Discovery 
(LLDP-MED), which enable the switches to automatically 
discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their power 
requirements, and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) parameters. LLDP-
MED-based granular PoE management allows the EX3300 to 
negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on powered 
devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across the switch.

The EX3300 supports the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE) 802.3az standard for Energy Efficient Ethernet 
(EEE) functionality, reducing power consumption of copper 
physical layers (PHY) during periods of low link utilization.

In addition, the EX3300 supports rich quality-of-service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The 
switches support eight QoS queues on every port, enabling them to 
maintain multilevel, end-to-end traffic prioritization. The EX3300 
also supports a wide range of scheduling options, such as priority 
and shaped deficit weighted round-robin (SDWRR) scheduling.

An external redundant power system (RPS) delivering additional 
power resiliency is also available.

Data Center Gigabit Ethernet Server Access
The EX3300 switches are optimized for GbE server access 
deployments in the data center, with front-to-back and back-
to-front cooling. The four SFP+ uplink ports on the EX3300 can 
operate at 10 Gbps simultaneously, offering up to 20GbE of uplink 
connectivity to each of the dual aggregation switches.

Security
The EX3300 switches fully interoperate with Juniper Networks 
Unified Access Control, which consolidates all aspects of a user’s 
identity, device, and location, enabling administrators to enforce 
access control and security down to the individual port or user 
levels. Working as an enforcement point within the UAC, the 
EX3300 provides both standards-based 802.1X port-level access 
control and Layer 2-4 policy enforcement based on user identity, 
location, and/or device. A user’s identity, device type, machine 
posture check, and location can be used to not only grant or deny 
access but also to determine the duration of access. If access is 
granted, the switch assigns the user to a specific VLAN based on 
authorization levels. The switch can also apply QoS policies or 
mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring, or 
threat detection by intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

The EX3300 also provides a full complement of port security 
features, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
snooping, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), and media access control 
(MAC) limiting to defend against internal and external spoofing, 
man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Data SheetEX3300 Ethernet SwitchJunos Operating System
The EX3300 switches run the same Junos OS used by other EX 
Series Ethernet Switches, as well as Juniper routers and Juniper 
Networks SRX Series Services Gateways. By utilizing a common 
operating system, Juniper delivers a consistent implementation 
and operation of control plane features across all products. 
To maintain that consistency, Junos OS adheres to a highly 
disciplined development process that uses a single source code, 
follows a single quarterly release train, and employs a highly 
available modular architecture that prevents isolated failures 
from bringing an entire system down.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version; customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

High Availability
The EX3300 line of Ethernet switches is designed to support 
many of the same failover capabilities and high availability (HA) 
functionality as the Juniper Networks EX4200 line of Ethernet 
switches with Virtual Chassis technology.

Each EX3300 switch is capable of functioning as a Routing 
Engine when deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration. When 
two or more EX3300 switches are interconnected in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, all member switches share a single control 
plane. Junos OS automatically initiates an election process to 
assign a master (active) and backup (hot-standby) Routing 
Engine. An integrated Layer 2 and Layer 3 graceful Routing Engine 
switchover (GRES) feature maintains uninterrupted access to 
applications, services, and IP communications in the unlikely 
event of a master Routing Engine failure. 

When more than two switches are interconnected in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the remaining switch elements act as line 
cards and are available to assume the backup Routing Engine 
position should the designated master fail. Master, backup 
and line card priority status can be assigned by the network 
operations team to dictate the order of ascension. This N+1 
Routing Engine redundancy, coupled with GRES, the nonstop 
routing (NSR) and, in the future, the nonstop bridging (NSB) 
capabilities of Junos OS, ensures a smooth transfer of control 
plane functions following unexpected failures.

The EX3300 also supports the following HA features:

•  Redundant trunk group:  To avoid the complexities of 

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) without sacrificing network 
resiliency, the EX3300 employs redundant trunk groups to 
provide the necessary port redundancy and simplify switch 
configuration.

•  Cross-member link aggregation:  Cross-member link 

aggregation allows redundant link aggregation connections 

between devices in a single Virtual Chassis configuration, 
providing an additional level of reliability and availability.

•  Non-Stop Bridging (NSB) and Non-stop Routing (NSR): 

NSB and NSR on the EX3300 switch ensure control plane 
protocols, states and tables are synchronized between 
master and backup REs to prevent protocol flaps or 
convergence issues following a Routing Engine failover.

•  Non-Stop Software Upgrade (NSSU):  With NSSU, all 

members of an EX3300 Virtual Chassis configuration can 
be upgraded with a single command.  Mission-critical traffic 
can be configured as a link aggregate across multiple Virtual 
Chassis switch members, ensuring minimal disruption during 
the upgrade process.

Simplified Management and Operations
When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX3300 
dramatically simplifies network management.  Up to 10 
interconnected EX3300 switches can be managed as a single 
device utilizing a single Junos OS image file and a single 
configuration file, reducing the overall number of units to monitor 
and manage. When the Junos OS is upgraded on the master 
switch in an EX3300 Virtual Chassis configuration, the software 
is automatically upgraded on all other member switches at the 
same time.

The EX3300 includes port profiles that allow network 
administrators to automatically configure ports with security, 
QoS, and other parameters based on the type of device 
connected to the port. Six preconfigured profiles are available, 
including default, desktop, desktop plus IP phone, WLAN access 
point, routed uplink, and Layer 2 uplink. Users can select from 
the existing profiles or create their own and apply them through 
the command-line interface (CLI), J-Web Software interface, or 
Junos Space network management system.

In addition, a feature called System Snapshot makes a copy 
of all software files used to run the switch, including the Junos 
operating system, the active configuration and the rescue 
configuration, that can be used to reboot the switch at the next 
power-up or as a backup boot option.  The Junos OS software 
can also be preinstalled on a flash drive and used to boot the 
EX3300 at any time.

Another feature, called automatic software download, enables 
network administrators to easily upgrade the EX3300 using 
the DHCP message exchange process to download and install 
software packages.  Users simply configure the automatic 
software download feature on EX3300 switches acting as DHCP 
clients and establish a path to the server where the software 
package file is installed.  The server then communicates the path 
to the software package file through DHCP server messages.

An EZ touchless provisioning feature allows a DHCP server to 
push configuration details and software images to multiple 
switches at bootup.
