Product Overview

The ADSL2/2+ Mini-Physical Interface 
Modules (Mini-PIMs) are for use with 
the Juniper Networks SRX200 line, 
which consists of Juniper Networks 
SRX210 Services Gateway, SRX220 
Services Gateway, and SRX240 
Services Gateway secure router 
products. The ADSL2/2+ Mini-PIMs, 
one supporting Annex A over plain 
old telephone service (POTS) and the 
other Annex B over ISDN, each include 
one physical asymmetric digital 
subscriber line (ADSL) port.

MINI-PHySICAL 
INTERFACE MODULES 
(MINI-PIM)

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® single-port ADSL2/2+ Mini-PIMs for the SRX200 line can be used to 
provide ADSL WAN connectivity. The ADSL2/2+ Annex A (over POTS) and ADSL2/2+ 
Annex B (over ISDN) support ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ standards. 

The ADSL2/2+ Mini-PIM has interoperability with the digital subscriber line access 
multiplexer (DSLAM) vendor products.

LEDs 
Mini-PIM LEDs indicate port status with the following LED states:

•  SyNC – Green on indicates that the ADSL interface is trained; 
blinking means that training is in progress; off means that the 
interface is idle

•  TX/RX – Green blinking indicates that traffic is passing through; off 

means that no traffic is passing through
