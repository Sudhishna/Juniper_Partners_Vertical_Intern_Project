Data SheetEach EX4300 switch includes a single application-specific 
integrated circuit (ASIC)-based Packet Forwarding Engine, the 
EX-PFE. The integrated Routing Engine (RE) delivers all control 
plane functionality. The EX4300 also leverages the same modular 
Junos OS as other Juniper Networks switches, routers, and security 
devices, ensuring a consistent implementation and operation of 
control plane features across the Juniper Networks infrastructure.

Architecture and Key Components
The EX4300 switches are single rack unit devices that deliver 
a compact solution for crowded wiring closets and access 
switch locations where space and power are at a premium. 
Each EX4300 supports standard 40GbE QSFP+ ports which are 
preconfigured to support high-speed Virtual Chassis backplane 
connections. These ports can also serve as uplinks to upstream 
aggregation devices. In addition, each EX4300 supports an 
optional front panel uplink module offering 1GbE or 10GbE 
ports for high-speed backbone or link aggregation connections 
between wiring closets and upstream aggregation switches. 
Uplink modules can be installed without powering down the 
switch, enabling users to add high-speed connectivity at any 
time or migrate from one uplink type to the other, delivering the 
ultimate in flexible, high-performance interconnectivity. 

The EX4300 also features a front panel LCD that offers a flexible 
interface for performing device bring-up and configuration 
rollbacks, reporting switch alarm and LED status, or restoring the 
switch to its default settings. When deployed as a member of a 
Virtual Chassis configuration, the LCD also displays the switch’s 
chassis “slot number” and RE status for rapid identification and 
problem resolution. 

The four integrated rear panel 40GbE QSFP+ ports support 
EX4300 Virtual Chassis deployment over a 320 Gbps virtual 
backplane. When deployed in close proximity such as in wiring 

closets or in top-of-rack data center applications, the EX4300 
switches can be securely connected using standard 40GbE QSFP+ 
DAC cables (available in 50 cm, 1 m, 3 m and 5m lengths). 

Switches deployed in Virtual Chassis configurations spread over 
larger areas can be interconnected using optical QSFP+ transceivers 
such as the QSFP+ SR4, which supports distances up to 150 m.

A dedicated rear panel RJ-45 port is available for out-of-band 
management, while a rear panel USB port can be used to easily 
upload Junos OS and configuration files. In addition, a dedicated 
front panel USB console port and a rear panel RJ-45 console port 
offer flexible out-of-band console options.

Virtual Chassis Technology

Up to 10 EX4300 switches can be interconnected using Virtual 
Chassis technology, creating a single logical device supporting 
up to 480 10/100/1000BASE-T ports, plus up to 40 additional 
10GbE and 40 additional 40GbE uplink ports. For mixed 1GbE and 
10GbE access environments, the EX4300 can be interconnected 
with the QFX3500, QFX3600 and QFX5100 high-performance 
data center access switches. EX4300 Virtual Chassis 
configurations can be created to support a variety of port and 
density options for data center, campus and branch deployments. 
Virtual Chassis connections can be formed using any of the 
40GbE ports or 10GbE ports using standard DAC cables and 
optics. The EX4300 does not support Virtual Chassis technology 
on the GbE copper or fiber ports.

Virtual Chassis Deployments in Campus Wiring Closets

In campus wiring closets, flexible topologies can be created using 
standard QSFP+ optics on the 40GbE ports to extend the Virtual 
Chassis configuration across long distances spanning multiple 
wiring closets, floors, or even buildings while using 10GbE or 
40GbE for uplink connectivity. EX4300 fiber-based switches can 
also be used for campus aggregation or small core deployments.

Virtual Chassis Fabric Switching Architecture 

Existing Virtual Chassis technology is further scaled and 
enhanced to support a spine-and-leaf topology that is ideal for 
high-performance and low-latency data center deployments. 
In its first instance, this topology, called Virtual Chassis Fabric, 
enables up to 20 switches to be deployed in a spine-and-leaf 
configuration, with two to four QFX5100 switches in the spine 
and up to 18 QFX5100, QFX3500, QFX3600 or EX4300 switches 
as leaf nodes. This architecture provides any rack-to-any rack 
deterministic throughput and low latency, while significantly 
simplifying network operations through a single point of 
management. A Virtual Chassis Fabric configuration supports 
mixed 1GbE, 10GbE and 40GbE servers.

Features and Benefits
Chassis-Class Availability

The EX4300 line of Ethernet switches delivers high availability 
through redundant power supplies and fans, GRES, and non-
stop bridging and routing when deployed in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration.

In a Virtual Chassis configuration, each EX4300 switch is 
capable of functioning as a Routing Engine. When two or more 
EX4300 switches are interconnected, a single control plane is 
shared among all Virtual Chassis member switches. When two 
EX4300 switches are interconnected, Junos OS automatically 
initiates an election process to assign a master (active) and 
backup (hot-standby) Routing Engine. An integrated Layer 2 
and Layer 3 GRES feature maintains uninterrupted access to 
applications, services, and IP communications in the unlikely 
event of a primary RE failure. 

When more than two switches are interconnected in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the remaining switch elements act as 
line cards and are available to assume the backup RE position 
should the designated master fail. Master, backup, and line card 

priority status can be assigned to dictate the order of ascension; 
this N+1 RE redundancy, coupled with the GRES, nonstop routing 
(NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB) capabilities of the Junos OS, 
assures a smooth transfer of control plane functions following 
unexpected failures.

The EX4300 implements the same slot/module/port numbering 
schema as other Juniper Networks chassis-based products 
when numbering Virtual Chassis ports, providing true chassis-
like operations. By utilizing a consistent operating system and 
a single configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration are treated as a single device, simplifying overall 
system maintenance and management. 

Individually, the EX4300 offers a number of HA features that are 
typically associated with modular chassis-based switches. When 
combined with the field-proven Junos OS and L2/L3 failover 
capabilities, these features provide the EX4300 with true carrier-
class reliability.

•  Redundant power supplies: The EX4300 line of Ethernet 

switches supports internal redundant, load-sharing, hot-
swappable, and field-replaceable AC and DC power supplies 
to maintain uninterrupted operations. Thanks to its compact 
footprint, the EX4300 requires significantly less power than 
chassis-based switches delivering equivalent port densities.

•  Hot-swappable fans: The EX4300 includes hot-swappable 
fans, providing sufficient cooling even if one of the fans were 
to fail.

•  Non-Stop Bridging (NSB) and Non-Stop Routing (NSR): 

NSB and NSR on the EX4300 ensure control plane protocols, 
states and tables are synchronized between Master and 
Standby REs to prevent protocol flaps or convergence issues 
following a Routing Engine failover.

•  Redundant trunk group (RTG): To avoid the complexities 

of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) without sacrificing network 
resiliency, the EX4300 employs redundant trunk groups to 
provide the necessary port redundancy and simplify switch 
configuration.

•  Cross-member link aggregation: Cross-member link 

aggregation allows redundant link aggregation connections 
between devices in a single Virtual Chassis configuration, 
providing an additional level of reliability and availability.

•  Carrier-class hardware: The EX4300 leverages a purpose-

built packet forwarding engine ASIC, the EX-PFE, which 
integrates much of the same intellectual property used 
in Juniper Networks carrier-class routers. As a result, the 
EX4300 delivers the same predictable, scalable functionality 
found in the world’s largest networks.

• 

IPv4 and IPv6 routing support: IPv4 and IPv6 Layer 3 routing 
(OSPF and BGP) is available with an Enhanced license, 
enabling highly resilient networks.

Data SheetEX4300 Ethernet SwitchCarrier-Class Operating System

The EX4300 runs on Junos OS, the same operating system 
software used by other Juniper Networks switches, routers, and 
security devices.

By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. To maintain that consistency, Junos 
OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process that 
utilizes a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing an entire system down.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all products powered by Junos OS to be 
updated simultaneously with the same software release. All 
features are fully regression tested, making each new release a 
true superset of the previous version. Customers can deploy the 
software with complete confidence that all existing capabilities 
will be maintained and operate in the same way.

Converged Networks

The EX4300 line of Ethernet switches provides the highest levels 
of availability for the most demanding converged data, voice, 
and video environments, delivering the most reliable platform for 
unifying enterprise communications.

The EX4300 supports rich quality of service (QoS) functionality 
for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The switches 
support 12 QoS queues on every port, enabling them to maintain 
multilevel, end-to-end traffic prioritizations. The EX4300 also 
supports a wide range of policy options, including priority and 
weighted deficit round-robin (WDRR) queuing.

By providing 15.4 watts of Class 3 802.3af PoE on all ports to 
power voice over IP (VoIP) telephones, closed-circuit security 
cameras, wireless access points, and other IP-enabled devices, the 
EX4300 delivers a future-proofed solution for converging disparate 
networks onto a single IP infrastructure. The EX4300 switches also 
support standards-based 802.3at PoE+, which delivers up to 30 
watts per port for powering networked devices like multiple radio 
IEEE 802.11n wireless access points and video phones that may 
require more power than available with IEEE 802.3af. 

Link Layer Discovery Protocol–Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-
MED)-based granular PoE/PoE+ management allows the 
EX4300 to negotiate PoE/PoE+ usage down to a fraction of a 
watt on powered devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization 
across the switch.

To ease deployment, the EX4300 supports the industry-
standard LLDP and LLDP-MED, which enable the switches to 
automatically discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their 
power requirements, and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) parameters.

The EX4300 supports the IEEE 802.3az standard for Energy 
Efficient Ethernet (EEE) functionality, reducing power 
consumption of copper physical layers (PHY) during periods of 
low link utilization.

Security

The EX4300 line of Ethernet switches fully integrates with 
Juniper Networks Unified Access Control (UAC), which 
consolidates all aspects of a user’s identity, device, and location, 
enabling administrators to enforce access control and security 
down to the individual port or user levels.

Data SheetEX4300 Ethernet SwitchSimplified Management and Operations

When employing Virtual Chassis technology, the EX4300 
dramatically simplifies network management. Up to 10 
interconnected EX4300 switches can be managed as a single 
device. Each Virtual Chassis group utilizes a single Junos OS 
image file and a single configuration file, reducing the overall 
number of units to monitor and manage. When Junos OS is 
upgraded on the master switch in a Virtual Chassis configuration, 
the software is automatically upgraded on all other member 
switches at the same time. 

The EX4300 also includes port profiles that allow network 
administrators to automatically configure ports with security, 
QoS, and other parameters based on the type of device 
connected to the port. Six preconfigured profiles are available, 
including default, desktop, desktop plus IP phone, wireless access 
point, routed uplink, and Layer 2 uplink. Users can select from 
the existing profiles or create their own and apply them through 
the command line interface (CLI), Junos Web interface, or 
management system. 

The EX4300 switches can be managed through Junos Space 
Network Director*, a next-generation network management 
solution that allows users to visualize, analyze and control the 
entire enterprise network—data center and campus, physical and 
virtual, and wired and wireless—through a single pane of glass. 
It incorporates sophisticated analytics for real-time intelligence, 
trended monitoring, and automation to increase agility as well as 
faster rollout and activation of services.

For cloud deployments, Network Director provides a set of 
REST APIs that enable on-demand and dynamic network 
services by simplifying the consumption of services for multi-
tenant environments. With third-party cloud orchestration tool 
integration, the Network Director API enables automation and 
provisioning of Layer 2, Layer 3 and security services in the data 
center without the need for manual operator intervention.

Finally, the EX4300 switch system, performance, and fault data 
can be exported to leading third-party management systems such 
as HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli, and Computer Associates Unicenter 
software to provide a complete, consolidated view of network 
operations. 

Warranty

For warranty information, please visit www.juniper.net/support/
warranty/.

The UAC solution is composed of three main components: 
Juniper Networks Junos Pulse as the endpoint client (also 
available in an agent-less mode); the Junos Pulse Access Control 
Service running on a blade in a MAG Series Junos Pulse Gateway 
chassis or on a dedicated MAG Series appliance; and UAC 
enforcement points. Working as an enforcement point with the 
UAC solution, the EX4300 provides both standards-based 802.1X 
port-level access control as well as L2-L4 policy enforcement 
based on user identity, location, and/or device. A user’s identity, 
device type, machine posture check, and location can be used 
to determine whether access should be granted and for how 
long. If access is granted, the switch assigns the user to a specific 
VLAN based on authorization levels. The switch can also apply 
QoS policies or mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, 
monitoring, or threat detection by intrusion prevention systems. 

Additionally, a captive portal redirection feature redirects URLs 
from the EX4300 to the MAG Series gateway running Pulse Access 
Control Service for user authentication and authorization, making 
the UAC solution a “single source of truth” for user and device 
authentication and for enforcing role-based security policies. 

The EX4300 also provides a full complement of port security 
features, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
snooping, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), IP Source Guard, and 
media access control (MAC) limiting (per port and per VLAN) 
to defend against internal and external spoofing, man-in-the-
middle and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

MACsec

EX4300 switches support IEEE 802.1ae MACsec, providing 
support for link-layer data confidentiality, data integrity, and data 
origin authentication. The MACsec feature enables the EX4300 
to support 88 Gbps of near line-rate hardware-based traffic 
encryption on all GbE and 10GbE ports, including the base unit 
and optional uplink modules. 

Defined by IEEE 802.1AE, MACsec provides secure, encrypted 
communication at the link layer that is capable of identifying and 
preventing threats from denial of service (DoS) and intrusion 
attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle, masquerading, passive 
wiretapping and playback attacks launched from behind the 
firewall. When MACsec is deployed on switch ports, all traffic 
is encrypted on the wire but traffic inside the switch is not. This 
allows the switch to apply all network policies such as QoS, 
deep packet inspection and sFlow to each packet without 
compromising the security of packets on the wire.

Hop-by-hop encryption enables MACsec to secure 
communications while maintaining network intelligence. In 
addition, Ethernet-based WAN networks can use MACsec to 
provide link security over longhaul connections. MACsec is 
transparent to Layer 3 and higher-layer protocols and is not 
limited to IP traffic; it works with any type of wired or wireless 
traffic carried over Ethernet links.

1  Each switch ships standard with one power supply (including a power cord for the 

country to which it is being shipped), RJ-45 cable, RJ-45-to-DB-9 serial port adapter, 
and a 19” rack-mount kit. A second power supply is optional to provide resiliency. 
The appropriate power cord accompanying that power supply needs to be ordered 
separately. Virtual Chassis cables must be ordered separately and can be for any of the 
optics supported (40GbE DAC recommended for Virtual Chassis connections).

2 EFL includes license for OSPFv4/v6, PIM-SM/SSM/DM, IGMP v1/v2/v3 and VRF-Lite. AFL 

includes license for IS-IS and BGP (EFL needs to be purchased and installed separately 
before installing AFL).
