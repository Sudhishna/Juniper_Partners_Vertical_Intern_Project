BTI7800 Packet Optical  
Transport Systems

Product Overview

The growth in bandwidth-intensive 
applications, coupled with the 
migration from local compute/
storage models to cloud-based 
services, is driving a need for 
more efficient converged network 
infrastructure solutions, enabling 
improved network utilization, 
simplified large-scale operations, 
and lower cost per Gbps. 

The BTI7800 line of packet optical 
transport systems supports large 
scale 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 200 
Gbps wavelength capacities in an 
open SDN platform. Leveraging 
a rich set of optical capabilities, 
including coherent modules with 
integrated ROADMs, the BTI7800 
line helps network operators 
increase network capacity, reduce 
space/power/cooling costs, 
improve network utilization, and 
simplify the deployment of high-
value services. 

 

  

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® BTI7800 line of packet optical transport systems leverages a 
modular, flexible, pay-as-you-grow architecture. At the heart of the BTI7800 are flexible 
Universal Forwarding Modules (UFMs), each capable of switching up to 400 Gbps. UFMs 
can be equipped with 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 200 Gbps interfaces providing the flexibility 
to support a wide range of muxponder and transponder connectivity. Optimized for metro 
and regional networks, the BTI7800 devices support a broad range of interfaces, including 
10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, 200 Gbps, OTU2, OTU4, and OC-192/STM-64.

The BTI7800 line is managed by the Juniper Networks proNX software, an SDN-
architected, high-performance network management and control platform with open APIs, 
Web GUI interfaces, and software-enabled networking.

Architecture and Key Components
The BTI7800 Packet Optical Transport Systems integrate simple, plug-and-play 
reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) technology to increase the capacity 
of existing networks or roll out new 100 Gbps or 200 Gbps networks. A variety of blade 
options, including ROADM, optional amplifiers, and pluggable pre-amplifiers, satisfy diverse 
capacity, span and reach requirements, while optimizing equipment expenses. The system 
automatically discovers all network nodes and modules, and automatically establishes 
intra-node and extra-node connections, eliminating manually intensive and error-prone 
configuration tasks to streamline operations.

Features and Benefits

•  Leading density, space, and power: Designed for massive capacity in a compact 

footprint, the BTI7800 architecture supports up to 5.6 Tbps of wavelength capacity in 
a 14 U chassis, with 10/100/200 Gbps scale (2x200 Gbps per slot client and line-side 
connectivity) to 16.8 Tbps in a single rack.

•  Diverse capacity, span and reach capabilities: The BTI7800 integrates ROADM-on-

a-blade, improving deployment flexibility and economics.

•  Open management and control: Open SDN-architected proNX software and 

associated applications enable new levels of programmability, automation, and 
control, simplifying and accelerating service delivery.

• 

Investment protection and migration path to applications integration: The BTI7800 
modular architecture supports the addition of future interfaces and applications.
