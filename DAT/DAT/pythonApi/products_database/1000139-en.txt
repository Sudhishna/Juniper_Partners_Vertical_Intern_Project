Product Description 
With the ongoing deployment of IP networks, the efficiency and cost-savings gains of IP are 
being realized for a variety of applications and functions. Largely left out of this evolution 
have been the circuit-based applications such as time-division multiplexing (TDM) leased 
line and voice private branch exchange (PBX) connections, serial encryption connections, 
and analog and digital radio systems networking, because their synchronous transport 
requirements are not addressed by a packet-based network. The Juniper Networks® 
CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms enable customers to connect these circuit-based 
applications easily and reliably across the IP network, bringing them the advantages of 
converged multiservice IP networking.

The CTP Series includes the Juniper Networks CTP150, CTP2008, CTP2024, CTP2056 
Circuit to Packet Platforms, and the Juniper Networks CTPView Network Management 
System. The products are designed for government agencies, enterprises and service 
providers running circuit-based applications and range in size, port capacity and 
redundancy options.

of T1 and E1 service provisioned over an IP/MPLS 
network and enables interoperability between vendors.

Allows for connectivity of analog and digital radios  
over IP networks.

Provides a mechanism to deploy these systems over IP 
networks while maintaining critical communications.

Serial encryption  
over IP solution

Provides transport of KG/KIV bit-synchronous cipher 
text across an IP network.

Eliminates the need to deploy TDM or ATM 
equipment—saving cost, time, space, and power.

T1 and E1 backup over IP

Point-to-point T1 or E1 circuits can be automatically 
backed up over the IP/MPLS network. 

Eliminates redundant point-to-point circuit costs. The 
end application does not need to detect IP, saving 
software and hardware upgrade costs.

Feature Description

Benefit

CTPView Network 
Management System

Secure, multi-user, web-based network management 
system provides network monitoring, circuit 
provisioning, IP performance reporting, database 
backup, and circuit troubleshooting tools.

Multiple system and 
circuit clocking solutions

CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms are designed 
to use multiple external clocks as monitored and 
prioritized system references. Circuits are configured 
to use the system clock, external circuit timing, or to 
adaptively recover clock information from the remote 
port when required by the application or when no 
reference is configured.

Managers quickly deploy circuits and services while 
proactively monitoring the network. IP performance 
reports provide detailed information on IP network 
jitter, delay and packet loss. Circuit troubleshooting 
tools include integral BERTS and loops to facilitate 
quick trouble resolution.

Circuit reliability is improved since ports and systems 
are configured with the clocking solution that is most 
appropriate for the particular application.

Auto switch

Packet protector

Autobaud

Loops and BERTs

Layer 2 IP aggregation

The status of the CTP Series circuit ports is 
monitored, and the circuit is automatically switched 
to an alternate local or remote port when a failure is 
detected.

Network and circuit reliability are increased when 
the circuits are automatically restored to alternate 
locations and equipment in the event of an equipment, 
site or network failure.

Redundant packets are created and transmitted to the 
IP network and then processed by the receiving CTP 
Series.

Circuit quality and reliability are increased when IP 
connections experience significant packet loss caused 
by bit errors.

The input timing leads are monitored, and the circuit 
rate is automatically changed at both ends of the 
network if a rate change is detected.

Each CTP Series port supports interface and network 
loops and the ability to generate and monitor a 
bit error rate test with up to nine BERT patterns 
selectable.

The CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms can 
aggregate layer 2 traffic from serial EIA530 interfaces 
onto a Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet interface. 
Layer 2 protocols supported are Frame Relay, PPP and 
Cisco-HDLC. Each CTP Series port is connected to a 
different VLAN.

Flexible rate agility enables immediate and automatic 
provisioning changes.

Support for standard circuit troubleshooting tools that 
are built into the CTP Series help to quickly isolate 
network, circuit or cable problems.

The ability to aggregate layer 2 traffic on the CTP 
Series from multiple EIA530 serial interfaces reduces 
the router interfaces needed for low-speed EIA530 IP 
aggregation.

Port mirroring

The CTP Series is able to port-mirror any transmit or 
any receive up to 10 local or remote destinations.

Analog voice—4WE&M

The CTP Series supports analog 4WE&M type I, II,and 
V interfaces with software selectable transmit and 
receive-level adjustments per interface.

Port mirroring minimizes the bandwidth required 
to send the same traffic to multiple sites across 
the network. It enables easy monitoring for 
troubleshooting circuit problems. Port mirroring 
enables the replication of data to multiple local or 
geographically dispersed locations.

The ability to support analog 4WE&M interfaces 
allows the CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms 
to offer another PBX trunking option. The 4WE&M 
interface can also be used for radio interfaces with 
push-to-talk requirements.

Analog voice—2WFXS

The CTP Series supports analog 2WFXS loop 
start, ground start, and PLAR modes with software 
selectable transmit and receive-level adjustments per 
interface.

The ability to support analog 2WFXS interfaces allows 
the CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms to offer 
2-wire voice extensions over IP for remote phones,  
remote central office or PBX equipment.

Analog voice—2WFXO

The CTP Series support analog 2WFXO loop start and 
ground start modes with software selectable transmit 
and receive-level adjustments per interface.

Voice compression

The CTP Series Voice Compression module supports 
64k G.711, 32k G.726, 16k G.726, 16k G.728, 8k G.729, 
and 2.4k MELP compression algorithms. The voice 
compression module also supports echo cancellation, 
silence suppression, fax and modem detection, and 
companding conversion.

The ability to support analog 2WFXO interfaces allows 
the CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms to offer 
2-wire voice extensions over IP to remote phones, or 
remote central office or PBX equipment.

Voice compression can be applied on any T1 or E1 DS0 
and on the analog 4WE&M interfaces. The use of voice 
compression and silence suppression can dramatically 
reduce the bandwidth required in the IP network. 
Multiple DS0s or analog channels can be bundled into 
one packet to further reduce the bandwidth required in 
the IP network.

IRIG-B

The CTP Series supports an inter-range instrumentation 
group time code (IRIG-B) signal to be transported 
through an IP network. IRIG-B encodes day of year, hour, 
minute, and second data on a 1-KHz carrier frequency, 
with an update rate of once per second.

Provides the ability to support IRIG-B transport over 
the IP network with options to configure direction, 
output high and low levels, and data range per 
interface.
