Product Description 
Data centers are rapidly adopting cloud services, whether completely off-premise models 
or hybrid models with critical services offered through on-premise private clouds. The 
tremendous growth of off-premise cloud services, coupled with the widespread adoption 
of overlay technologies, has created a need for highly agile switching platforms that can 
satisfy the demands of these evolving data centers. 

The high-performance Juniper Networks® QFX5110 line of Ethernet switches fit the 
bill, providing the foundation for dynamic data centers. As a critical enabler for IT 
transformation, the data center network supports cloud and SDN adoption, network 
virtualization, integrated/scale-out storage, and the rapid deployment and delivery of 
mission-critical applications that significantly increase east-west traffic within the data 
center. Furthermore, increasing demand for 100GbE spine ports is driving the need for 
100GbE uplinks for all server access speeds, including 10GbE and 40GbE. The QFX5110 
includes 100GbE uplinks, enabling it to support a diverse set of switching architectures, 
including fabric, Layer 3, and spine-and-leaf deployments, enabling users to easily adapt as 
requirements change over time. 

Architecture and Key Components
The QFX5110 switches include 10GbE (fiber) and 40GbE or 100GbE fixed-configuration 
options with rich Layer 2, Layer 3, and MPLS features. The QFX5110 switches run the 
same reliable, high-performance Juniper Networks Junos® operating system that is 
used by the Juniper Networks QFX5100 family of products, EX Series Ethernet Switches, 
Juniper Networks routers, and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways, ensuring 
a consistent implementation and operation of control plane features across the entire 
Juniper infrastructure.

Today’s data centers are typically built with high-performance, 
small form-factor, multicore blade and rack servers. The greater 
compute capacity and server densities enabled by these devices 
are increasing traffic volume, creating a need for high-speed, 
low-latency, storage-converged and I/O-converged networking 
solutions that can maximize performance for physical servers, 
virtual servers, and storage. 

The QFX5110 switches deliver low-latency, lossless, high-density 
10GbE and 40GbE interfaces, as well as 100GbE uplinks to the 
core network demanded by today’s data center. Furthermore, 
the QFX5110 offers VXLAN Layer 2 gateway support, making it 
an ideal solution for overlay deployments in the data center. All 
QFX5110 switches are designed to consume the lowest possible 
power while optimizing space, reducing data center operating 
costs. Flexible airflow direction options enable the QFX5110 
switches to support back-to-front and front-to-back cooling, 
ensuring consistency with server designs for hot-aisle or cold-
aisle deployments.

Data Center Server Access

The QFX5110 switches are ideal for top-of-rack deployments 
of various densities and speeds. The QFX5110-48S offers 48 
ports of native 10GbE for server connectivity, plus up to four 
40GbE or 100GbE ports for uplink connectivity, providing very low 
oversubscription of 1.2:1 from access to aggregation. Meanwhile, 
the QFX5110-32Q offers 20 QSFP+ 40GbE ports for server 
connectivity and up to four 100GbE ports for uplink connectivity, 
providing an oversubscription of 2:1 from access to aggregation.

The QFX5110 switches can operate in both cut-through and 
store-and-forward modes, delivering sustained wire-speed 
switching with sub-microsecond latency and low jitter for any 
packet size (including jumbo frames) in both modes. All QFX 
Series switches support extensive Layer 2 features, enabling 
the device to support high-density 10GbE Layer 2 access 
deployments. With features such as multichassis link aggregation 
group (MC-LAG), the QFX5110 supports active/active server dual 
homing and can utilize full bisectional bandwidth from server to 
switch. When the QFX5110 is deployed in the access layer, MC-
LAG on QFX10000 switches in the aggregation layer provides 
maximum resiliency and full Layer 2 multipathing in the network.

The Junos OS features the most advanced and robust routing 
capabilities in the industry. All QFX5110 switches include 
support for RIP and OSPF for both IPv4 and IPv6 in the base 
software. Advanced routing capabilities such as IS-IS and BGP 
are also supported. With additional capabilities like 64-way 
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) and BGP add path, the QFX5110 
is an ideal building block for deploying the most robust Layer 3 
underlay for SDN.

Features and Benefits

•  Automation—The QFX5110 switches support a number 
of features for network automation and plug-and-play 
operations. Features include zero touch provisioning, 
operations and event scripts, automatic rollback, and Python 
scripting. The switch also supports integration with VMware 
NSX Layer 2 Gateway Services, and OpenStack. 

•  Flexible Forwarding Table—The QFX5110 includes a 

Unified Forwarding Table (UFT), which allows the hardware 
table to be carved into configurable partitions of Layer 2 
media access control (MAC), Layer 3 host, and longest 
prefix match (LPM) tables. In a pure L2 environment, the 

QFX5110 supports 288,000 MAC addresses. In Layer 3 
mode, the table can support 208,000 host entries. In LPM 
mode, it can support 128,000 prefixes. Junos OS provides 
configurable options through a CLI so that each QFX5110 
can be optimized for different deployment scenarios. 

• 

Intelligent Buffer Management—The QFX5110 switches 
have a total of 16 MB shared buffers. While 25% of the total 
buffer space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports 
and is user configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism 
in the QFX5110 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while 
providing deterministic performance, significantly increasing 
performance over static allocation.

•  MPLS—QFX5110 switches support a broad set of MPLS 

features, including L3 VPN, IPv6 provider edge router (6PE), 
RSVP traffic engineering, and LDP to allow standards-
based network segmentation and virtualization. This 
enables the QFX5110 to be deployed as a low-latency MPLS 
label-switching router (LSR).

•  VXLAN—The QFX5110 switch is capable of supporting Layer 

2 gateway services. The QFX5110 supports controller-less 
VXLAN deployment through EVPN for Layer 2 gateway, 
control plane (OVSDB) protocols.

Installation and Implementation Service
Juniper Professional services offers a Data Center Switching 
QuickStart program to ensure that the solution is operational 
and the customer has a complete understanding of areas such 
as configuration and ongoing operations. The QuickStart service 
provides an on-site consultant who works with the client team 
to quickly develop the initial configuration and deployment of a 
small Juniper Networks data center switching environment.  A 
knowledge transfer session, which is intended as a review of local 
implementation and configuration options, is also included, but is 
not intended as a substitute for formalized training.
