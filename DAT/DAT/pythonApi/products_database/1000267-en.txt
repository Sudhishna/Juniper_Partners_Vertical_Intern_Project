SRX3400 and SRX3600 
Services Gateways

Product Overview

SRX Series Services Gateways 
are next-generation security 
platforms based on a 
revolutionary architecture 
offering outstanding protection, 
performance, scalability, 
availability, and security service 
integration. Custom designed for 
flexible processing scalability, 
I/O scalability, and services 
integration, the SRX Series 
exceeds the security requirements 
of data center consolidation 
and services aggregation. The 
SRX Series is powered by Junos 
OS, the same industry-leading 
operating system platform 
that keeps the world’s largest 
networks available, manageable, 
and secure for the data center.

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® SRX3400 Services Gateway and SRX3600 Services Gateway are 
next-generation security plaforms that deliver outstanding protection, market-leading 
performance, scalability and service integration in a mid-sized form factor. These devices 
are ideally suited for medium to large enterprise, public sector and service provider 
networks, including:

•  Enterprise server farms/data centers

•  Mobile operator environments

•  Aggregation of departmental or segmented security solutions

•  Cloud and hosting provider data centers

•  Managed services deployments

In terms of security, these platforms feature next-generation firewall services such as 
application security, Unified Threat Management (UTM) and Intrusion Prevention System 
(IPS). Integrated threat intelligence via Spotlight Secure offers adaptive threat protection 
against command and control (C&C) related botnets, and policy enforcement based on 
GeoIP and attacker fingerprinting technology (the latter for Web application protection)—
all of which are based on Juniper provided feeds. Customers may also leverage their own 
custom and third-party feeds for protection from advanced malware and other threats.

Based on an innovative mid-plane design and Juniper’s dynamic services architecture, 
the SRX3000 line resets the bar in price/performance for enterprise and service provider 
environments. Each services gateway can support near linear scalability with each 
additional Services Processing Card (SPC), enabling the SRX3600 to support up to 55 
Gbps of firewall throughput. The SPCs are designed to support a wide range of services 
enabling future support of new capabilities without the need for service-specific hardware. 
Using SPCs on all services ensures that there are no idle resources based on specific 
services in operation—maximizing hardware utilization.

Market leading flexibility and price/performance of the SRX3000 line comes from the 
modular architecture. Based on Juniper’s dynamic services architecture, the gateway 
can be equipped with a flexible number of I/O cards (IOCs), network processing cards 
(NPCs) and service processing cards (SPCs)—allowing the system to be configured to 
support the ideal balance of performance and port density enabling each deployment 
of the Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways to be tailored to specific network 
requirements. With this flexibility, the SRX3600 can be configured to support more than 
100 Gbps interfaces with choices of Gigabit Ethernet or 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports; firewall 
performance up to 55 Gbps; and services processing to match specific business needs.

Data SheetThe switch fabric employed in the SRX3000 line enables the 
scalability of SPCs, NPCs, and IOCs. Supporting up to 320 Gbps 
of data transfer, the fabric enables the realization of maximum 
processing and I/O capability available in any particular 
configuration. This level of scalability and flexibility facilitates 
future expansion and growth of the network infrastructure, 
providing unrivaled investment protection.

The flexibility of the SRX3000 line extends beyond the 
innovation and proven benefit of the dynamic services 
architecture. Enabling the installation of SPCs on both the front 
and the back of the SRX3000 line, the mid-plane design delivers 
market-leading flexibility and scalability. By doubling the number 
of SPCs supported in half the rack space needed, the SRX3000 
line offers not only underlying architectural innovation but also an 
innovative physical design.

The tight service integration on SRX Series Services Gateways 
is enabled by Juniper Networks Junos® operating system. By 
combining the routing heritage of Junos OS and the security 
heritage of ScreenOS®, the SRX Series Services Gateways are 
equipped with a robust list of features that include firewall, 
intrusion prevention system (IPS), VPN (IPsec), denial of service 
(DoS), application security, Network Address Translation (NAT), 
unified threat management (UTM), and quality of service (QoS). 
In addition, incorporating multiple networking and security 
services under a single OS greatly optimizes the flow of traffic 
through the platform. With Junos OS, the SRX Series enjoys the 
benefit of a single source OS and one architecture that is also 
available across Juniper’s carrier-class routers and switches.

SRX3600 
The SRX3600 Services Gateway is a market-leading security 
solution supporting up to 55 Gbps firewall, 15 Gbps firewall and 
IPS, or 15 Gbps of IPsec VPN along with up to 270,000 new 
connections per second. Equipped with the full range of security 
services, the SRX3600 is ideally suited for securing medium to 
large enterprise data centers, hosted or co-located data centers, 
or securing next-generation enterprise services/applications. It 
can also be deployed to secure cloud provider infrastructures 
where multi-tenancy is a requirement or to secure mobile 
operator environments. The scalability and flexibility of the 
services gateway makes it ideal for consolidating legacy security 
appliances in densely populated data centers, and the service 
density makes it ideal for cloud or mobile providers. 

SRX3400 
The SRX3400 Services Gateway uses the same SPCs, IOCs and 
NPCs as the SRX3600 and can support up to 30 Gbps firewall, 
8 Gbps firewall and IPS, or 8 Gbps of IPsec VPN, along with up 
to 150,000 new connections per second. The SRX3400 is ideally 
suited for securing and segmenting enterprise data centers/
network infrastructure as well as aggregation of various security 
solutions. The capability to support unique security policies per 
zones and its ability to scale with the growth of the network 
makes the SRX3400 an ideal deployment for small to midsized 
server farms, hosting sites, or mobile operators. 

SRX3000 Line Service Processing Cards* 
As the “brains” behind the SRX3000 line, SPCs are designed to 
process all available services on the platform. By eliminating the 
need for dedicated hardware for specific services or capabilities, 
there are no instances in which any piece of hardware is taxed 
to the limit while other hardware sits idle. SPCs are designed 
to be pooled together, allowing the SRX3000 line to expand 
performance and capacities with the introduction of additional 
SPCs, drastically reducing management overhead and 
complexity. The same SPCs are supported on both the SRX3600 
and SRX3400. (Note: A minimum of one NPC and one SPC is 
required for proper system functionality.)

SRX3000 Line I/O Cards*
In addition to supporting an ideal mix of built-in copper, small 
form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP) and high availability 
(HA) ports, the SRX3000 line allows the greatest I/O port 
density of any comparable offering in the same class. Each 
services gateway in the SRX3000 line can be equipped with one 
or several IOCs, each supporting either 16-gigabit interfaces (16 
x 1 copper or fiber Gigabit Ethernet), or 20-gigabit interfaces (2 x 
10 Gigabit XFP Ethernet). With the flexibility to provide multiple 
IOCs, the SRX3000 line can be equipped to support an ideal 
balance between interfaces and processing capabilities. (Note: 
A minimum of one NPC and one SPC is required for proper 
system functionality.)

SRX3000 Line Network Processing Cards*
To ensure maximum processing performance and flexibility, 
the SRX3000 line utilizes NPCs to distribute inbound and 
outbound traffic to the appropriate SPCs and IOCs, apply 
QoS, and enforce DoS/distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
protections. The SRX3600 can be configured to support one to 
three NPCs, while the SRX3400 can be configured to support 
one or two NPCs. Providing additional NPCs to the SRX3000 
line allows organizations to tailor the solution to fit their specific 
performance requirements. (Note: A minimum of one NPC and 
one SPC is required for proper system functionality.)

In addition, the SRX3000 line also has a new combination NPC/
IOC card, NP-IOC. This card expands the gateway’s capacity by 
serving the two functions, network processing and input/output, 
with just one card in one slot. Like the other cards, this one 
supports In-service software upgrades; In addition It supports in-
service hardware upgrades. It is fully, backward compatible with 
the current SRX3000 chassis and cards.

*The Juniper Networks SRX3000 line utilizes the same market 
leading, high-performance dynamic architecture as the SRX5000 
line, but in a mid-plane form factor. The SRX3000 line SPCs, 
IOCs, and NPCs are based on a common form-factor module 
(CFM) design and are not compatible with the SRX5000 line. 
Likewise, all SRX5000 line modules are not compatible with the 
SRX3000 line.
