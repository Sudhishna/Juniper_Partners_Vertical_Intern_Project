vMX Virtual Router

Product Overview

Service providers, cloud operators, 
and enterprises need highly 
agile, scalable, and automated 
networks in order to increase 
revenue, contain capital spending, 
and achieve operational 
excellence. Network Functions 
Virtualization (NFV), which 
decouples network functions 
from service-specific elements so 
they can run as software on x86 
servers, is a critical technology for 
achieving these goals.  

The vMX Virtual Router is 
a virtualized MX Series 3D 
Universal Edge Router that helps 
network operators of all types 
improve customer experience 
and profitability by increasing 
network and service agility and 
accelerating time to market for 
new services, while streamlining 
their operations environment.

 

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® vMX Virtual Router, available as licensed software for deployment 
on x86-based servers, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and on the NFX250-S2-R Network 
Services Platform, supports a broad range of broadband, cloud, cable, mobile, and enterprise 
applications. The vMX control plane is powered by Juniper Networks Junos® operating 
system, the same OS that powers the entire Juniper Networks MX Series 3D Universal Edge 
Routers portfolio, and the forwarding plane is powered by vTrio, Juniper’s programmable Trio 
chipset microcode optimized for execution in x86 environments. With Junos OS and vTrio, the 
vMX offers advanced routing, quality of service (HQoS), and switching features that ensure 
the agile and highly efficient delivery of the widest variety of services. 

The feature-rich vMX, built on 17 years of Juniper routing investment experience, increases 
service agility by enabling users to quickly implement and scale services by spinning up 
new routing instances on demand, and by supporting non-disruptive service introductions 
in parallel with current services. This approach eliminates the risk, complexity, and delay 
associated with reconfiguring and requalifying your current infrastructure for new services. 
Furthermore, the vMX has a granular licensing model that accommodates uncertain 
forecasts, enabling users to purchase only the amount of capacity they need, reducing the 
risk of stranded capital. 

The vMX also eliminates the cost, complexity, and delay associated with qualifying, 
maintaining, and sparing physical routing elements. This enables rapid service deployment 
and scale-out of services, which are critical success factors when expanding into niche 
markets and new geographies. Importantly, these same attributes help overcome issues 
related to equipment acquisition for lab trials and release certification. 

Importantly, the vMX offers feature consistency with the physical MX Series platforms, 
including support for high-performance virtual route reflection as well as virtual broadband 
network gateway (BNG) capabilities, including L2TP network server/Layer 2 Tunneling 
Protocol (LNS/L2TP), Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4/DHCPv6), Pseudowire Headend Termination (PWHT) 
support, and static and dynamic (RADIUS) subscriber interface support. Additionally, a 
suite of virtualized services are available for the vMX, including IPsec, Layer 7 application 
awareness, stateful firewall, and carrier-grade Network Address Translation (NAT), which 
significantly extends the range of applications that the vMX can satisfy. Together, these 
sophisticated features help service providers implement advanced, virtualized, and 
distributed architectures that enable the profitable delivery of innovative services in new 
and traditional markets.

Architecture and Key Components

World-Class Routing for World-Class Networks 

The vMX consists of the following:

•  Virtual control plane (VCP), which is Junos OS hosted on a 

virtual machine (VM).

•  The virtual forwarding plane (VFP) runs the packet 
forwarding engine, which is the programmable Trio 
microcode optimized and compiled for x86 environments. 
Intel toolkits, including Data Plane Development Kit 
(DPDK) and Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV), are also 
employed to further enhance forwarding performance.

OpenStack provides VM management and provisioning of 
infrastructure network connections, allowing vMX orchestration 
like any other cloud-based application and enabling customers 
to nondisruptively add the vMX to their operational environments. 
Additionally, the vMX is fully integrated with the Juniper Networks 
Contrail® Cloud Platform™, a turnkey cloud management solution 
that is hardened with open-source technologies including 
OpenStack, OpenContrail, Chef, and Puppet.

Features and Benefits
MX Series and vMX: Consistent, Compatible, and 
Complementary

The vMX utilizes the same Junos operating system and 
programmable Trio chipset microcode as the physical MX Series 
portfolio. The vMX and MX Series routers can be selected based 
on specific goals and objectives without any operational penalty 
or risk, enabling customers to control the pace of their network 
evolution without disrupting established operating environments.

MX Series customers can use the vMX to scale out their networks 
without impacting operations or staff training.  Similarly, 
customers can use the vMX to satisfy immediate needs and 
adopt MX Series routers for service scale-up at some future point, 
again without operational disruption.

The vMX is a true carrier-class router that supports the same 
broad set of IPv4/IPv6 capabilities available in the MX Series 
portfolio. This includes comprehensive VPN support at Layer 2 
(virtual private LAN service, L2 circuits, L2VPN, and EVPN); Layer 
2.5/MPLS (LDP, RSVP, P2MP LDP, and RSVP, with class of service/
QoS); Layer 3 (unicast and multicast L3VPNs with CoS/QoS); 
BNG/LNS; and a variety of multicast techniques (physical interface 
module, Internet Group Management Protocol, Multicast Listener 
Discovery, multicast generic routing encapsulation). 

Comprehensive BNG Capabilities

The vMX makes an ideal BNG for extending broadband services 
to residential consumers and extending network access to 
wholesalers.  The extensive suite of BNG feature support includes 
L2TP network server/Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (LNS/L2TP), 
Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4/v6), Pseudowire Headend 
Termination (PWHT), static and dynamic (RADIUS) subscriber 
interfaces, DHCP local server and relay, QinQ, integrated firewall 
filters, and reverse-path forwarding (RPF) check.

High-Performance Virtual Route Reflection

The vMX also supports virtual route reflection, which is optimized 
for high scale and performance and offers key features such 
as route target address family (RFC4684), BGP ADD_PATH, 4 
byte Adaptive Services system support, L2VPN address families 
(RFC4761, RFC6074), and multihop BFD for both BGPv4 and 
BGPv6. Virtual route reflection helps operators efficiently 
increase network scale and avoid the cost and complexity of 
dedicated physical routing platforms.

Data SheetvMX Virtual RouterImprove Control Plane Scale

Edge routers can run out of control plane resources before they 
run out of forwarding plane resources. The vMX overcomes this 
issue by allowing  independent control plane and forwarding scale, 
enabling very large forwarding tables and a high number of flows 
to be supported.

Flexible Implementation Models

The vMX is available as licensed software for x86-based servers 
and on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace where it can 
provide secure routing between AWS virtual path connections 
(VPCs), private clouds, and on-premises resources. Additionally, 
AWS customers can bring their own vMX license or take 
advantage of hourly or annual “pay-as you-go” pricing. The vMX 
can also be installed on the NFX250-S2-R, enabling customers 
to deploy a single-vendor hardware/software solution.

Value-Added Service Integration

A suite of licensed virtual services, including IPsec to Layer 
7 application awareness (based on deep packet inspection 
technology), stateful firewall, and carrier-grade NAT, can be 
optionally added to the vMX. These virtual services broaden the 
use cases and revenue opportunities that network operators can 
address while maintaining a single OS for routing and services. 

Try Before You Buy

A free 60-day trial makes it easy to evaluate and qualify the vMX 
in your own network. Visit www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/free-vmx-
trial/ to download a vMX trial license. At the end of the trial period, 
a seamless conversion to purchase process ensures that there is 
no need to reinstall the vMX. You can also access a free 60-day 
vMX trial on AWS for the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model or 
a free 30-day vMX trial for the Pay As You Go license model.

Low-Risk Market Entry and Expansion

Uncertain forecasts, facility costs, and pressure from incumbents 
can be formidable barriers to new market entry and geographic 
expansion. Implementing the vMX in data centers or collocation 
facilities instead of dedicated telco facilities is an easy and low-
risk way to enter new markets and increase or decrease network 
capacity in response to disparities between forecast and actual 
service uptake. As demands grow, the vMX is easily scaled up; 
or conversely, if a service or market underperforms, vMX licenses 
and servers can be easily redeployed without stranding assets. 

Automation and Programmability

Included in Junos OS, the Junos Automation Toolkit is a suite of 
tools supported on all Juniper Networks switches, routers, and 
security devices. These tools, which leverage the native XML 
capabilities of Junos OS, include commit scripts, op scripts, 
event policies and event scripts, and macros that help automate 
operational and configuration tasks. Additionally, the Juniper 

Extension Toolkit (JET) provides a modern programmable toolkit 
while maintaining a platform independent architecture, and 
includes support for: 

•  OpenConfig/YANG 

•  gRPC, Thrift, NETCONF 

•  JSON/XML 

•  API support for all modern programming languages 

•  Rich on-box scripting support using Python 

•  REST APIs 

Together, Junos OS automation and programmability features 
save time by automating operational and configuration tasks, 
reduce the chance for error, speed troubleshooting, and maximize 
network uptime by warning operators of potential problems and 
automatically responding to system events.
