Product Overview

The Juniper Networks single-port VDSL2 
Mini-Physical Interface Module (Mini-
PIM) for the Juniper Networks SRX200 
line provides VDSL2/ADSL2+/ADSL2 
WAN connectivity ideal for remote 
branch deployments requiring high-
speed WAN access for asymmetrical 
transmission rates up to 100 Mbps. 

DATASHEET

SINGLE-PORT VDSL2 
ANNEX A MINI-PHYSICAL 
INTERFACE MODULE  
(MINI-PIM)

Product Description 
The VDSL2 Annex A Mini-PIM is for use with the SRX200 line consisting of the Juniper 
Networks® SRX210 Services Gateway, SRX220 Services Gateway, and SRX240 Services 
Gateway products. The VDSL2 Mini-PIM supports Annex A over plain old telephone service 
(POTS), which includes one physical very high bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) port. 
The VDSL2 Annex A (over POTS) Mini-PIM supports ADSL, ADSL2, or ADSL2+ fallback 
standards to provide the flexibility to support multiple DSL options.

The VDSL2 mini-PIM has interoperability with the following DSLAM vendor products. For 
the complete and latest list, please refer to Juniper Networks technical publications.
