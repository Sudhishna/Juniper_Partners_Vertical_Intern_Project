•  Managed service providers

•  Core service provider infrastructures

•  Large enterprise data centers

The SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800 support Juniper’s Software-Defined Secure 
Network (SDSN) framework, which is built around automated and actionable intelligence 
that can be shared quickly to recognize and mitigate threats.

Delivering the highest level of protection from Layer 3 to Layer 7, these platforms feature a 
carrier-grade next-generation firewall and advanced security services such as application 
security, unified threat management (UTM), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and 
integrated threat intelligence services. 

For advanced protection, the SRX Series offers integrated threat intelligence services 
via Juniper Networks Spotlight Secure, Juniper’s open threat intelligence platform in the 
cloud. Spotlight Secure delivers actionable security intelligence to SRX Series devices to 
enable advanced protection against Command and Control (C&C)-related botnets and 
Web application threats, as well as allowing policy enforcement based on GeoIP data—all 
based on Juniper-provided feeds. Customers may also leverage their own custom and 
third-party feeds for protection from advanced malware and other threats unique to 
their business environment. This advanced, customer-relevant, and consolidated threat 
intelligence service is delivered to the SRX Series on premises from the cloud. 

The SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800 are supported by Juniper Networks Junos® Space 
Security Director, which enables distributed security policy management through an 
intuitive, centralized interface that enables enforcement across emerging and traditional 
risk vectors. Using intuitive dashboards and reporting features, administrators gain insight 
into threats, compromised devices, risky applications, and more.

Based on Juniper’s Dynamic Services Architecture, the SRX5000 line provides unrivaled 
scalability and performance. Each services gateway can support near linear scalability 
with the addition of Services Processing Cards (SPCs) and I/O cards (IOCs), enabling a 
fully equipped SRX5800 to support up to 2 Tbps firewall throughput with Express Path 
enabled—an industry first for firewall performance. The SPCs are designed to support a 
wide range of services, enabling future support of new capabilities without the need for

Data Sheetservice-specific hardware. Using SPCs on all services ensures 
that there are no idle resources based on specific services being 
used—maximizing hardware utilization.

The scalability and flexibility of the SRX5000 line is supported by 
equally robust interfaces. The SRX5000 line employs a modular 
approach, where each platform can be equipped with a flexible 
number of IOCs that offer a wide range of connectivity options, 
including 1GbE, 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE interfaces. With the 
IOCs sharing the same interface slot as the SPCs, the gateway 
can be configured as needed to support the ideal balance of 
processing and I/O. Hence, each deployment of the SRX Series 
can be tailored to specific network requirements.

The scalability of both SPCs and IOCs in the SRX5000 line 
is enabled by the custom-designed switch fabric. Supporting 
up to 960 Gbps of data transfer, the fabric enables realization 
of maximum processing and I/O capability available in 
any particular configuration. This level of scalability and 
flexibility enables future expansion and growth of the network 
infrastructure, providing unrivaled investment protection.

The tight service integration on the SRX Series is enabled by 
Juniper Networks Junos® operating system. The SRX Series is 
equipped with a robust set of services that include stateful 
firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), denial of service 
(DoS), application security, VPN (IPsec), Network Address 
Translation (NAT), unified threat management (UTM), and 
quality of service (QoS). In addition to the benefit of individual 
services, the SRX5000 line provides a low latency solution.

Junos OS also delivers carrier-class reliability with six 
nines system availability, the first in the industry to achieve 
independent verification by Telcordia. Furthermore, the SRX 
Series enjoys the benefit of a single source OS, and single 
integrated architecture traditionally available on Juniper’s carrier-
class routers and switches. 

SRX5800
The SRX5800 Services Gateway is the market-leading security 
solution supporting up to 2 Tbps firewall throughput and latency 
as low as 7 microseconds with the Express Path capability. 
The SRX5800 also supports 100 Gbps IPS and 100 million 
concurrent sessions. Equipped with the full range of advanced 
security services, the SRX5800 is ideally suited for securing large 
enterprise, hosted, or colocated data centers, service provider 
core and cloud provider infrastructures, and mobile operator 
environments. The massive performance, scalability, and 
flexibility of the SRX5800 make it ideal for densely consolidated 
processing environments, and the service density makes it ideal 
for cloud and managed service providers.

SRX5600
The SRX5600 Services Gateway uses the same SPCs and 
IOCs as the SRX5800 and can support up to 960 Gbps firewall 
throughput with Express Path, 76 million concurrent sessions, 
and 50 Gbps IPS. The SRX5600 is ideally suited for securing 
enterprise data centers as well as aggregation of various security 

solutions. The capability to support unique security policies 
per zone and its ability to scale with the growth of the network 
infrastructure make the SRX5600 an ideal deployment for 
consolidation of services in large enterprise, service provider, or 
mobile operator environments.

SRX5400
The SRX5400 Services Gateway uses the same SPCs and IOCs 
as the SRX5800 and can support up to 480 Gbps firewall with 
Express Path, 28 million concurrent sessions, and 22 Gbps IPS. 
The SRX5400 is a small footprint, high-performance gateway 
ideally suited for securing large enterprise campuses as well 
as data centers, either for edge or core security deployments. 
The ability to support unique security policies per zone and a 
compelling price/performance/footprint ratio make the SRX5400 
an optimal solution for edge or data center services in large 
enterprise, service provider, or mobile operator environments.

Service Processing Cards (SPC) 

As the “brains” behind the SRX5000 line, SPCs are designed 
to process all available services on the platform. Without the 
need for dedicated hardware for specific services or capabilities, 
there are no instances in which a piece of hardware is taxed 
to the limit while other hardware is sitting idle. SPCs are 
designed to be pooled together, allowing the SRX5000 line to 
expand performance and capacities with the introduction of 
additional SPCs, drastically reducing management overhead and 
complexity. The SPC2 is supported on the SRX5400, SRX5600, 
and SRX5800 Services Gateways. 

I/O Cards (IOCs)

To provide the most flexible solution, the SRX5000 line employs 
the same modular architecture for SPCs and IOCs. The SRX5000 
line can be equipped with one or several IOCs, supporting the 
ideal mix of interfaces. With the flexibility to install an IOC or an 
SPC on any available slot, the SRX5000 line can be equipped 
to support the perfect blend of interfaces and processing 
capabilities, meeting the needs of the most demanding 
environments while ensuring investment protection.

Juniper offers the IOC2, a second-generation card with superior 
connectivity options. The IOC2 offers the industry’s first 100GbE 
as well as 40GbE and high-density 10GbE and 1GbE connectivity 
options. These options reduce the need for link aggregation 
when connecting high throughput switches to the firewall, as 
well as enabling increased throughput in the firewall itself. The 
IOC2 is supported on all three platforms in the SRX5000 line of 
services gateways.

The third generation of IOCs from Juniper, the IOC3, delivers the 
highest throughput levels yet, along with superior connectivity 
options including 100GbE, 40GbE, and high-density 10GbE 
interfaces. The IOC2 or IOC3 operates with the Express Path 
optimization capability, delivering higher levels of throughput—up 
to an industry-leading 2 Tbps on the SRX5800. The IOC3 cards 
are supported on the SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800.

(SSD). The SRX5K-SCB3 Enhanced System Control Board (SCB3) 
enables 240 Gbps per slot throughput with intra as well as 
interchassis high availability and redundancy.

within the same line card, Express Path identifies and prioritizes 
active session flows to receive appropriate security treatment 
based on the type of traffic and the level of inspection required. This 
ensures that security is maintained at all times while performance 
and latency needs are met. Express Path significantly reduces 
network latency and improves performance of selected traffic types, 
making it ideal for high-speed, latency-sensitive applications. With 
Express Path, the SRX5000 line of Services Gateways delivers low 
latency and high throughput with six nines reliability. 

Express Path
The IOC2 and IOC3 cards support the Express Path capability, which 
securely optimizes SRX5000 line performance to improve IMIX 
bandwidth by identifying traffic flows that do not require additional 
inspection or deep processing. Configurable on a per-policy basis 

With Express Path, the SRX5000 line of Services Gateways 
can achieve line-rate speeds. Supporting single, extremely high 
bandwidth flows of up to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps, Express Path

*    In 12.3X48-D10, the Services Offload feature was renamed Express Path and is included 
without requiring a license for Junos OS X48 releases and beyond. With the X48 release, 
the Express Path feature is supported on all SRX5000 Services Gateways including 
the SRX5400. For versions prior to the X48 release, the Services Offload license is still 
required and supports only SRX5600 and SRX5800 products.

   Express Path is available on the SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800 Services Gateways. 
  No separate license required.
