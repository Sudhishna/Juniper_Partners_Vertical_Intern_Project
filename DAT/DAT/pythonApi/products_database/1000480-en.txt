details, see the QFX5100-24Q-AA data sheet.

Junos OS

All four high-performance QFX5100 switches run Junos OS, 
Juniper’s powerful and robust network operating system. Key 
Junos OS features that enhance the functionality and capabilities 
of the QXF5100 include:

•  Software modularity with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and 
with the ability to do process restarts

•  Uninterrupted routing and forwarding with features such as 

nonstop routing (NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB)

•  Commit and rollback functionality that ensures error-free 

network configurations 

•  A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 

reporting, and resolution

Junos Space Network Director 

The QFX5100 switches can be managed through Junos Space 
Network Director, a next-generation network management 
solution that allows users to visualize, analyze, and control the 
entire enterprise network—data center and campus, physical 
and virtual, wired and wireless—through a single pane of glass. 
Network Director incorporates sophisticated analytics for real-
time intelligence, trended monitoring, and automation to increase 
agility as well as faster rollout and activation of services.

For cloud deployments, Network Director provides a set of REST 
APIs that enable on-demand and dynamic network services 
by simplifying the consumption of services for multitenant 
environments. With third-party cloud orchestration tool 
integration, the Network Director API enables automation and 
provisioning of Layer 2, Layer 3, and security services in the data 
center without the need for manual operator intervention.

Virtual Chassis Technology

The QFX5100 supports Juniper Networks’ unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, which enables up to 10 interconnected switches to 
be managed and operated as a single, logical device with a single 
IP address. Virtual Chassis technology enables enterprises to 
separate physical topology from logical groupings of endpoints 
and, as a result, provides efficient resource utilization. All 
QFX5100 switches can participate in the same Virtual Chassis 
configuration, along with any combination of EX4300, QFX3500, 
and QFX3600 Ethernet switches, delivering highly flexible and 
scalable configuration options for data center deployments.

QFabric System

Existing Virtual Chassis technology is further scaled and enhanced 
to support a spine-and-leaf topology that is ideal for high-
performance and low-latency data center deployments. In its 
first instance, this topology, called Virtual Chassis Fabric, enables 
up to 20 QFX5100 switches to be deployed in a spine-and-leaf 
configuration, with two to four QFX5100s in the spine and up to 18 
QFX5100s as leaf nodes. This architecture provides any-rack-to-
any-rack deterministic throughput and less than 3 microseconds 
of latency, while significantly simplifying network operations 
through a single point of management. EX4300, QFX3500, and 
QFX3600 switches can also act as leaf nodes in a Virtual Chassis 
Fabric deployment, providing support for data centers with 
mixed 1GbE, 10GbE, and 40GbE servers as well as environments 
transitioning from 1GbE to 10GbE or 40GbE servers while 
protecting existing EX4300, QFX3500, and QFX3600 investments.

The QFX5100 also supports a Layer 2 VxLAN Gateway feature 
in Virtual Chassis Fabric mode, creating a single Hardware VTEP 
for an entire Virtual Chassis Fabric pod (a single management 
domain of up to 20 devices) that would exist on all nodes. Virtual 
Chassis Fabric enables a plug-and-play architecture; hence 
no VTEP configuration changes are required when adding or 
removing nodes from the Virtual Chassis Fabric pod. For MAC 
address learning, Virtual Chassis Fabric  supports both EVPN as 
well as OVSDB, and also integrates with VMware NSX.

Junos Fusion

Junos Fusion, an IEEE 802.1Br standards-based Ethernet fabric, is 
ideal for mid-to-large data center customers who want simplicity 
at scale.  

The open, easy-to-deploy Junos Fusion provides a single point of 
management and plug-and-play operation for networks with a 
choice of 1GbE, 10GbE and 40GbE for server access.  In a Junos 
Fusion deployment, QFX5100 switches are deployed as Satellite 
devices that are managed by the QFX10000 switches deployed 
as Aggregation devices. (see Figure 1).

The QFX5100-48S and QFX5100-48T can also act as a QFabric 
Node device in a QFX3000-M and QFX3000-G QFabric System. 
The QFX5100-48S and QFX5100-48T are fully interoperable 
with existing QFX3500 and QFX3600 QFabric Nodes, providing 
backward compatibility and investment protection. With a 
mixture of QFX3500, QFX3600, and QFX5100 Nodes, a QFabric 
System can scale on a node by node basis without being limited 
by the lowest common denominator. 

Data Center Deployments

Today’s data centers are built with high-performance, small 
form-factor, multicore blade and rack servers. The greater 
compute capacity and server densities enabled by these devices 
is increasing traffic levels, creating the need for high-speed, low-
latency, storage- and I/O-converged networking solutions that 
can maximize performance for physical servers, virtual servers, 
and storage in the data center. 

The QFX5100 line offers a portfolio of switches that deliver the 
low-latency, lossless, high-density 10GbE and 40GbE interfaces 
with the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch 
functionality demanded by today’s data center. All QFX5100 
models are designed to consume the lowest power possible while 
optimizing space, thereby reducing data center operating costs. 
Flexible airflow direction options enable the QFX5100 to support 
back-to-front and front-to-back cooling, ensuring consistency with 
server designs for hot- and cold-aisle deployments.

Data Center Server Access

The QFX5100 line of switches is ideal for top-of-rack 
deployments of various densities and speeds. 

The compact 1 U QFX5100-48S offers 48 ports of native 10GbE 
for server connectivity and up to six 40GbE ports for uplink 
connectivity, providing very low oversubscription of 2:1 from access 
to aggregation. Each 40GbE port can be further broken out into four 
10GbE ports, providing additional 10GbE for server connectivity.

The QFX5100-48T offers 48 RJ-45-based 10GbE ports and up 
to six 40GbE ports for providing uplinks to aggregation switches.  
Each RJ-45 port can operate in three different speeds, providing 
10GbE, 1GbE or 100 Mbps server connectivity  using the same 
shielded twisted pair copper cables.  Distances up to 100m can  
be supported using cables that conform to IEEE 802.3-2012 
specifications, enabling the QFX5100-48T to be deployed as a 
top-of-rack, middle-of-row or end-of-row switch. 

The 2 U QFX5100-96S is a high-density native 10GbE data center 
access switch that is ideal for deployments with a high degree of 
application redundancy. The highly efficient QFX5100-96S offers 
96 ports of native 10GbE for server connectivity and eight 40GbE 
ports for uplink connectivity, providing very low oversubscription 
of 3:1 from access to aggregation.

The QFX5100-24Q offers 24 QSFP+ ports in the base unit with 
an option to scale up to 32 QSFP+ ports with two four-port 
expansion modules. Each QSFP+ port can be used for native 
40GbE server port connectivity or channelized into four 10GbE 
ports for 10GbE server connectivity, offering maximum flexibility 
and investment protection for data center growth. 

Each of the QFX5100 switches can operate in both cut-through 
and store-and-forward modes, delivering sustained wire-
speed switching with sub-microsecond latency and low jitter 
for any packet size (including jumbo frames) in both modes. 
All QFX Series switches support extensive Layer 2 features, 
enabling the device to support high-density 10GbE/FCoE Layer 
2 access deployments. With features such as multi-chassis 
link aggregation group (MC-LAG), the QFX5100 supports 

active/active server dual homing and can utilize full bisectional 
bandwidth from server to switch. When the QFX5100 is deployed 
in the access layer, MC-LAG on QFX10000 switches in the 
aggregation layer provides maximum resiliency and full Layer 2 
multi-pathing in the network (see Figure 2).

The Junos operating system features the most advanced and 
robust routing capabilities in the industry. All QFX5100 switches 
include support for RIP and OSPF for both IPv4 and IPv6 in the 
base software. Advanced routing capabilities such as IS-IS and 
BGP are also supported. With additional capabilities like 64-way 
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) and BGP add path, the QFX5100 
is an ideal building block for deploying the most robust Layer 3 
underlay for software-defined networks (SDN) (see Figure 3).

In addition, the QFX5100 also supports Virtual Chassis Fabric 
and QFabric System deployments. These fabric technologies 
support both Layer 2 multi-pathing and Layer 3 ECMP paths 
within the same network fabric while dramatically reducing the 
number of user configured protocols, thus eliminating the need 
to run protocols such as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol 
(VRRP) for Layer 3 gateway load balancing and complex multicast 
protocols to set up replication trees. Virtual Chassis Fabric and 
QFabric technology dramatically reduce the complexity and cost 
of managing the data center network by making multiple switches 
appear as a single, logical device. Virtual Chassis Fabric allows up 
to 20 individual switches to be managed via a single CLI, while a 
QFabric System enables up to 128 Nodes to operate as a single 
device (see Figures 4 and 5).

Features and Benefits

•  Topology-Independent In-Service Software Upgrade 

(TISSU*): With its Intel core processor, the QFX5100 
allows Junos OS to run within a virtual machine (VM) on 
Linux. Junos OS runs in two separate VMs in active and 
standby pairs; during software upgrade cycles, the switches 
seamlessly move to the newer software version while 
maintaining intact data plane traffic. This true Topology-
Independent ISSU, an industry-first software upgrade feature 
for a fixed-configuration top-of-rack switch, is supported 
across all Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols and doesn’t need the 
support of any other switches to perform an image upgrade.

•  Automation: The QFX5100 switches support a number 
of features for network automation and plug-and-play 
operations. Features include zero-touch provisioning, 
operations and event scripts, automatic rollback, and 
Python scripting. The switch also offers support for 
integration with VMware NSX Layer 2 Gateway Services, 
Puppet, and OpenStack. 

•  Flexible Forwarding Table: The QFX5100’s Flexible Forwarding 

Table (FFT) allows the hardware table to be carved into 
configurable partitions of Layer 2 media access control (MAC), 
Layer 3 host, and Longest Prefix Match (LPM) tables. In a 
pure L2 environment, the QFX5100 supports 288,000 MAC 
addresses. In L3 mode, the table can support 128,000 host 
entries, and in LPM mode, it can support 128,000 prefixes. 
Junos OS provides configurable options through a command-
line interface (CLI) so that each QFX5100 can be optimized for 
different deployment scenarios. 

• 

Intelligent Buffer Management: The QFX5100 switches 
have a total of 12 MB shared buffers. While 25% of the total 
buffer space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports 

* TISSU supported only in standalone mode, not in Virtual Chassis Fabric deployments.

and is user configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism 
in the QFX5100 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while 
providing deterministic performance, significantly increasing 
performance over static allocation.

• 

Insight Technology for Analytics: The QFX5100 provides 
dynamic buffer utilization monitoring and reporting with an 
interval of 10 milliseconds to provide microburst and latency 
insight. The data can be viewed via CLI, system log, or 
streamed to external servers for more analysis. Supported 
reporting formats include Java Script Object Notification 
(JSON), CSV and TSV. These files can be consumed 
by orchestration systems, SDN controllers, or network 
management applications (such as Juniper Networks Junos 
Space Network Director) to make better network design 
decisions and identify network hotspots.

•  MPLS: QFX5100 switches support a broad set of MPLS 

features, including L3 VPN, IPv6 provider edge router (6PE), 
RSVP traffic engineering, and LDP to allow standards-based 
network segmentation and virtualization. The QFX5100 can 
be deployed as a low-latency MPLS label-switching router 
(LSR) or MPLS PE router in smaller scale environments. The 
QFX5100 is the industry’s only compact, low-latency, high-
density, low-power switch to offer an MPLS feature set.

•  VXLAN: The QFX5100 supports Layer 2 gateway services 

that enable VXLAN-to-VLAN connectivity at any tier of the 
data center network, from server access to the edge. For 
MAC address learning, the QFX5100 supports both EVPN as 
well as OVSDB, and also integrates with VMware NSX.

•  FCoE: As a Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch, 

the QFX5100 provides an IEEE data center bridging (DCB) 
converged network between FCoE-enabled servers and an 
FCoE-enabled Fibre Channel storage area network (SAN). 
The QFX5100 offers a full-featured DCB implementation that 

5

Data SheetQFX5100 Ethernet Switchprovides strong monitoring capabilities on the top-of-rack 
switch for SAN and LAN administration teams to maintain 
clear separation of management. In addition, FCoE Initiation 
Protocol (FIP) snooping provides perimeter protection, 
ensuring that the presence of an Ethernet layer does not 
impact existing SAN security policies. FCoE link aggregation 
group (LAG) active/active support is available to achieve 
resilient (dual-rail) FCoE connectivity. 

The FCoE transit switch functionality, including priority-based 
flow control (PFC), Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), and 
Data Center Bridging Capability Exchange (DCBX), are included 
as part of the default software.
