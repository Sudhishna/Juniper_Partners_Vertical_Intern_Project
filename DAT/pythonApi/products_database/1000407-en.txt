QFX3600-I QFabric 
Interconnect 

Product  Overview

The QFX3600-I QFabric 
Interconnect provides the high-
speed transport that serves as 
the backplane of a QFX3000-M 
QFabric System, supporting 
data centers with up to 16 racks 
where each rack contains 48 
10GbE compute and storage 
network ports. The QFX3000-M—
consisting of QFX3500 and/
or QFX3600 QFabric Nodes, 
the QFX3600-I QFabric 
Interconnect and the QFX3100 
QFabric Director—operates 
and is managed as a single, 
logical device for supporting the 
next-generation virtualized and 
high-performance data center, 
lowering capital, management, 
and operational expenses.

Product Description
Juniper Networks® QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect is a fixed, 1 U device that acts as 
the backplane of a Juniper Networks QFX3000-M QFabric System, connecting any 
combination of QFX3500 and QFX3600 QFabric Node edge devices in a full mesh 
topology in 6:1, 3:1, or non-oversubscribed configurations.

High availability features on the QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect include three fan 
trays with a 2+1 redundancy model and redundant AC or DC power supplies. Featuring a 
switching capacity of 1.28 Tbps, the QFX3600-I offers 16 40 Gbps ports, providing data 
plane connectivity for the QFabric Nodes. Each QFabric Node connects to the QFX3600-I 
QFabric Interconnect via one to four 40 Gbps interfaces operating over standard OM3/OM4 
multimode fiber optic cables. Similar to the fabric inside a modular switch, there are no 
connections between the QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnects in the data center; the QFabric 
Interconnect only provides transport between QFabric Node devices. Four fully populated 
QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnects can scale the QFabric architecture to support 768 10GbE 
customer-facing ports, with an aggregate capacity of 5.12 Tbps and average port-to-port 
latency of 3 micro-seconds.  Each component within a QFX3000-M system data path has 
an average latency of 1 microsecond.

The QFX3600-I runs the same Juniper Networks Junos® operating system as other Juniper 
Networks switches, routers, and security devices. All provisioning and management is 
done via the Juniper Networks QFX3100 QFabric Director.  The control plane between the 
QFX3600-I Interconnect and the QFabric Director is established over a redundant out-of-
band copper or fiber control plane network using Juniper EX4200 switches. The QFX3600-I 
Interconnect has two copper 1GbE ports and two fiber 1GbE ports, either of which can be 
used to connect the Interconnect to the Director.

QFabric Architecture and Key Components
QFabric technology represents the “1” in Juniper’s 3-2-1 data 
center architecture. It dramatically reduces complexity by 
delivering any-to-any connectivity while lowering capital, 
management, and operational expenses. The Juniper Networks 
QFabric architecture helps organizations realize the full benefit of 
their investments in server consolidation, virtualization, service-
oriented architecture (SOA), distributed application architectures, 
and other technologies. The high-performance, non-blocking, 
and lossless QFabric architecture delivers much lower latency 
than traditional network architectures—crucial for the high-speed 
communications that define the modern data center. Rather than 
fragmented network and server capacity like traditional data 
center networks, QFabric technology implements a single, flexible 
architecture that enables organizations to achieve cloud-like 
efficiencies and create a more agile environment.

The following configuration rules apply with respect to the 
QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect:

•  QFX3600 QFabric Nodes provide 32 10GbE ports in non-

oversubscribed configurations, 48 10GbE ports in 3:1 or 6:1 
oversubscription, or 56 10GbE ports in 7:1 oversubscription 
when used in a QFX3000-M QFabric System with 
QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnects.

•  QFX3500 QFabric Nodes provide 16 10GbE ports in non-

oversubscribed configurations and 48 10GbE ports in 3:1 or 
6:1 oversubscription when used in a QFX3000-M QFabric 
System with QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnects.

four of which can be used to connect to QFX3600-I QFabric 
Interconnects. The number of uplinks in QFX3500 when 
used as a QFabric Node is not configurable.

•  The QFX3600 has a configurable number of uplinks. 

Although the default number is four, a QFX3600 QFabric 
Node can be configured with two, four, or eight uplinks to a 
QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect.

•  The maximum number of QFX3600-I QFabric 

Interconnects that can be supported in a QFX3000-M 
QFabric System is four.

Benefits

The QFX3600-I allows for multi-terabit scaling of the QFabric System. Each system scales to 1.28 Tbps; 
four fixed QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnects in a QFX3000-M QFabric System architecture allow for a 5.12 
Tbps data center fabric, creating an architecture that scales to 16 racks of converged compute and storage 
data center fabrics.

The 1 U fixed configuration QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect has power supplies that are 1+1 load-share 
redundant; if either power supply fails, the surviving power supply can provide full power to the QFX3600-I 
indefinitely.
The QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect cooling system is composed of three fan trays operating in a 
2+1 redundant configuration. If any fan tray fails, the system will continue operating indefinitely. The 
temperature sensors in the QFX3600-I continuously monitor internal temperatures and will automatically 
shut the system down to protect from thermal overstress.
When configured in high availability network architectures, parallel systems can operate in a 1:1 
redundancy scheme. If either QFX3600-I fails, the surviving system can provide a network path indefinitely.

Online insertion and removal of 
components

The QFX3600-I is a highly available system. All components, including power supplies, fan trays, optics, 
and USB keys, can be removed or inserted into the system in a nondisruptive fashion, providing “five 9s” 
system availability.

Operational enhancements

Front-to-back and back-to-front cooling: The QFX3600-I supports front-to-back cooling where fan field-
replaceable units (FRUs) and power supplies can be in the cold aisle, and ports where optics plug in can 
be in the hot aisle. Conversely, the QFX3600-I also supports back-to-front cooling where fan FRUs and 
power supplies can be in the hot aisle, while ports where optics plug in can be in the cold aisle.

Space-optimized form factor

The QFX3600-I QFabric Interconnect is designed for mid-tier, satellite and container data centers.
