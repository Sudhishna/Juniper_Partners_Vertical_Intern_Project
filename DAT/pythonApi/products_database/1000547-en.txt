PTX5000 and PTX3000 PICs   

Product Overview

Increased interactions between 
people and machines are 
creating a deluge of traffic, 
with increasingly unpredictable 
patterns. These dynamics have 
intensified the challenge to 
support growth with traditional 
network products and 
architectures. A new approach, 
based on both physical and 
virtual innovations, is required to 
help service providers stay ahead 
of growing traffic demands while 
remaining profitable. PTX Series 
Packet Transport Routers with 
flexible pluggable interface cards 
(PICs) provide service providers 
with a transit router that offers 
the right interface options for their 
high-performance environment.

Product Description 
Juniper NetworksÂ® PTX Series Packet Transport Routers are architected to provide industry-
leading system density in a transit-optimized IP/MPLS design. They deliver the ability to 
match traffic capacity with superior performance, meet any operational environment 
with elegant deployability, and exercise precise programmable traffic control through 
SDN across core, peering, metro, and collapsed IP and optical applications. The multiple 
generations of PTX Series hardware are built on Juniper Networks purpose-built Express 
and ExpressPlus silicon for robust IP/MPLS functionality and line-rate, low-latency packet 
performance for 1GbE to 100GbE and beyond. The PTX Series pluggable interface cards 
(PICs) offer operators the flexibility to deploy the appropriate interface type for the right 
application. Core applications ranging from 1GbE access handoffs to high-density 10GbE 
bundles for peering, 40GbE handoffs for data center interconnect, and 100GbE ultra-high-
speed IP/MPLS provider edge (PE) router, label edge router (LER), and label-switching 
router (LSR) interconnect are supported.

capacity link bundling, and traffic demanding edge router-to-core 
router aggregation.

2-Port 100GbE Coherent DWDM PIC

The 2-port 100GbE coherent dense wavelength-division 
multiplexing (DWDM) PIC leverages the latest Optical 
Internetworking Forum (OIF)-compliant optical technology 
to deliver an interface that can be tuned to 96 different ITU 
extended C-Band channels. The 2-port 100GbE coherent DWDM 
PIC transmits a DP-QPSK signal that uses a MODEM ASIC 
to provide soft decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) to 
increase the optical margins for 100GbE over long distances. The 
PIC contains a coherent receiver to correct linear and nonlinear 
effects that have accumulated traversing the fiber span. The 
2-port 100GbE coherent metro DWDM PIC supports full OTN 
performance monitoring, providing a fast reroute protection 
schema for improved network resiliency.

As network operators look for ways to accommodate unrelenting 
growth while trying to contain costs, they seek next-generation 
solutions that can scale efficiently. By integrating optical 
functionality into the router, service providers reduce the amount 
of optical equipment, rack space, and hardware needed to 
transmit the optical signal, resulting in lower power consumption. 
Optical integration into the PTX Series devices truly converges 
multiple networking layers into a single holistic network.

The multi-rate 60-port 10/40/100GbE LAN QSFP28 PIC provides 
variable interface support for service providers, eliminating 
the risk of deploying the wrong interface type per deployment 
while maintaining the ability to scale up. The multi-rate 60-port

5-Port 100GbE Coherent DWDM PIC

The 5-port 100GbE coherent dense wavelength-division 
multiplexing (DWDM) PIC leverages the latest Optical 
Internetworking Forum (OIF)-compliant optical technology 
to deliver an interface that can be tuned to 96 different ITU 
extended C-Band channels at 50 GHz channel spacing. The 
5-port 100GbE coherent DWDM PIC provides pay-as-you grow 
flexibility by using CFP2-ACO pluggable transceivers. The 5-port 
100GbE coherent DWDM PIC transmits a DP-QPSK signal that 
uses a MODEM ASIC to provide both soft decision forward error 
correction (SD-FEC) and G.709 generic forward error correction 
to increase the optical margins for 100GbE over long distances. 
The PIC contains a coherent receiver to correct linear and 
nonlinear effects that have accumulated while traversing the 
fiber span. The 5-port 100GbE coherent DWDM PIC supports full 
OTN performance monitoring, providing a fast reroute protection 
schema for improved network resiliency. 

As network operators look for ways to accommodate unrelenting 
growth while trying to contain costs, they seek next-generation 
solutions that can scale efficiently. By integrating optical 
functionality into the router, service providers can eliminate 
disparate optical equipment, saving rack space and lowering 
overall power consumption. Optical integration into the PTX 
Series devices truly converges multiple networking layers into a 
single holistic network fabric.

Integrated Photonics Line Card (IPLC)

The Integrated Photonics Line Card (IPLC) for the PTX3000 
fully collapses the optical layer with the IP/MPLS layer in a 
single metro network solution, eliminating the need to deploy 
separate, dedicated equipment for both IP/MPLS and optical. 
The IPLC tightly couples a 1x2 WSS, embedded bi-directional 
switch gain amplifiers, optical multiplexer/de-multiplexers, and 
optical supervisory channel for optical management into a single 
package that supports up to 64 ITU-T C-band wavelengths at 50 
Ghz spacing via an IPLC expansion line card. The IPLC maintains 
the same PTX Series PIC form factor, allowing it to be provisioned 
in any of the eight PIC slots within a PTX3000 (the IPLC is 
only supported in the PTX3000). Built to the ITU-T C-band 
wavelength standard, the IPLC is fully interoperable with existing 
PTX Series DWDM interfaces such as 2-Port 100GbE Coherent

party external alien wavelengths. The IPLC can be used for both 
point-to-point and ring applications with in-service upgradability, 
starting at 3.2 Tbps and growing up to 6.4 Tbps of fiber capacity 
via the IPLC optical expansion card (OPEC).

Inline Amplifier Module (ILM-A)

Juniper now also offers a standalone 1 U inline switch-gain inline 
amplifier for data center interconnect, metro/regional, and 
long-distance applications. When used in conjunction with the 
coherent DWDM PICs and the IPLC, the PTX3000, running Junos, 
automatically provisions all of the photonic layer parameters and 
learns the optical topologies for applications like Connectivity 
Services Director (CSD) to provision, monitor, and troubleshoot.
