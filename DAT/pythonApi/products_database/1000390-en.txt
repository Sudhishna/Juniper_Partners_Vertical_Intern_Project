EX6200 Line of 
Ethernet Switches 

Proiduct Overview

The Juniper Networks EX6200 
line of Ethernet switches is 
a scalable, resilient, high-
performance chassis-based 
wiring closet solution, providing 
extremely high port densities in 
a space-optimized form factor. 
With a choice of data only or 
Power over Ethernet (PoE) 
and PoE+ port options, the 
EX6200 delivers high availability 
and tremendous investment 
protection for enterprise campus 
environments, as well as data 
center access deployments using 
end-of-row designs. 

Product Description
Juniper Networks® EX6210 Ethernet Switch offers a total of 10 slots which allow for highly 
flexible configurations. Two of the slots are designed to hold Switch Fabric and Routing 
Engine (SRE) modules, while the remaining eight slots are dedicated I/O slots for holding 
any combination of EX6200 line cards. Since only one SRE module is required for switch 
operations, one of the SRE slots can be optionally configured as an I/O slot, enabling the 
switch to support a total of nine EX6200 line cards.

Each SRE module includes four 10GbE uplinks, while the line cards feature full PoE+ 
support to deliver complete investment protection. 

Architecture and Key Components
At 14 rack units (U) high and just 15.5 inches deep, the EX6210 is compact enough to easily 
fit in traditional wiring closets, making it ideal for campus deployments. 

The chassis is cooled front to back by a single fan tray with redundant fans (three groups of 
two each). The EX6210 can operate with a single fan failure, and in the unlikely event of an 
entire fan tray failure, the system will operate for two minutes with no cooling while the fan 
tray is replaced.

The EX6210 switch has four power supply slots and supports 2,500 W AC, 5,000 W AC, 
or 2,100 W DC power supplies (different power supplies should not be mixed in the same 
chassis). The EX6210 ships with a single power supply; up to three more load-sharing 
power supplies can be added and configured for N+1 or N+N (2+2) redundancy, providing 
up to 10,000 W AC (with 2,500 W AC PSUs), 20,000 W (with 5,000 W AC PSUs), or 8,400 
W DC (with 2,100 W DC PSUs) to the chassis.

Switch Fabric and Routing Engine Module

The SRE module, which provides 720 Gbps (full duplex) of switching capacity to the 
EX6200 chassis, includes an integrated switch fabric and is responsible for system 
configuration and management, running bridging and routing protocols, and managing the 
user interface. 

A front panel, chassis-level LCD panel displays Routing Engine status as well as chassis 
component alarm information for rapid problem identification and resolution to simplify 
overall operations. The LCD also provides a flexible, user-friendly interface for performing 
device initialization and configuration rollbacks, reporting system status and alarm 
notification, or restoring the switch to its default settings.

Campus Wiring Closet

Aggregation

Access

•  EX6200-48T: A 48-port 10/100/1000BASE-T RJ-45 line 
card offering 3 to 6 μs port-to-port latency for all packet 
sizes (except jumbo frame), eight quality-of-service (QoS) 
queues per port, and a 6 MB buffer for all 48 ports. 

•  EX6200-48P: Identical to the EX6200-48T, the EX6200-

48P also includes support for the IEEE 802.3at PoE+ 
standard on all 48 ports, delivering up to 30 watts of 
power per port for supporting networked devices such as 
telephones, video cameras, multiple radio IEEE 802.11n 
wireless LAN (WLAN) access points, and video phones in 
converged network environments. The EX6200-48P also 
supports the 802.3af PoE standard, which delivers up to 
15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE per port. 

•  EX6200-48F: Identical to the EX6200-48T, the EX6200-
48F supports 100BASE-X and 1000BASE-X optics on 48 
ports. The line card offers 3 to 6 μs port-to-port latency for 
all packet sizes (except jumbo frames), eight QoS queues 
per port, and a 6 MB buffer for all 48 ports.

Configuration Options and Port Densities

The EX6210 switch supports two primary configurations: high 
availability (HA) and high density.

•  HA configuration: In a redundant configuration with two 

SRE modules and up to eight EX6200 line cards installed, 
the EX6210 can support a maximum of 384 wire-speed 
10/100/1000BASE-T ports. 

•  High-density configuration: In a high-density configuration, 

one of the SRE modules is replaced with an additional line 
module, bringing the total number of 10/100/1000BASE-T 
input/output ports to a maximum of 432. Note that this 
configuration introduces minor oversubscription on the 
ports in the system.

Deployment Scenarios
The EX6210 is a highly scalable campus wiring closet solution, 
supporting up to 432 GbE access ports per chassis. The switch 
is designed for mobility and enterprise-class services with PoE+ 
on all ports, making it ideal for converged data, voice, and video 
deployment environments. 

The EX6210 is also hardware-ready to support IEEE 802.1ae 
MACSec, providing data confidentiality, data integrity, and data 
origin authentication. Software support on GbE ports will be 
available in a future release.

LLDP-MED-based granular PoE management allows the EX6210 
to negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on powered 
devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across the switch.

The EX6210 is also an ideal solution for GbE data center server 
access end-of-row or middle-of-row deployments. The switch’s 
modular chassis form factor enables IT to consolidate locations 
for networking equipment, while the front-to-back airflow 
optimizes data center deployments.

Junos Operating System
The EX6200 line runs the same Juniper Networks Junos® 
operating system used by other Juniper Networks switches, 
routers, and security devices. By utilizing a common operating 
system across multiple product families, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products.

Data SheetEX6200 Line of Ethernet Switches Security
The EX6200 line of Ethernet switches fully integrates with 
Juniper Networks Unified Access Control as well as third-party 
UAC solutions. UAC consolidates all aspects of a user’s identity, 
device, and location, enabling administrators to enforce access 
control and security down to the individual port or user level.

Working as an enforcement point within the UAC, the EX6200 
provides both standards-based 802.1X port-level access 
control as well as Layer 2–4 policy enforcement based on user 
identity, location, and/or device. A user’s identity, device type, 
machine posture check, and location can be used to determine 
whether access should be granted and for how long. If access is 
granted, the switch assigns the user to a specific VLAN based on 
authorization levels. The switch can also apply QoS policies or 
mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring, or 
threat detection by intrusion prevention systems.

The EX6200 also provides a full range of Layer 2 and Layer 3 
port security features, including Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) snooping, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), and 
media access control (MAC) limiting to defend against internal 
and external spoofing, man in the middle, and denial-of-service 
(DoS) attacks.

Management Capabilities 
The following system management options are available for the 
EX6200 line of Ethernet switches.

•  The standard Junos OS command-line interface (CLI) 

offers the same granular management capabilities and 
scripting parameters found in any router or switch powered 
by Junos OS.

•  The integrated Junos Web management tool provides an 

embedded device manager that allows users to configure, 
monitor, troubleshoot, and perform system maintenance on 
individual switches via a browser-based graphical interface.

•  Juniper Networks Junos Space, an open, programmable 

application platform for hosting a comprehensive suite of 
network operational application tools provides an open 
approach for automating the deployment and operation 
of a Juniper infrastructure. Explicitly designed to allow 
partners and customers to build and deploy smart, simple, 
and easy-to-use applications, Junos Space provides 
multiple management and infrastructure applications for 
managing Juniper resources and assets, including inventory 
management, device and interface configuration, automated 
software management and deployment, and event-driven 
fault management. These Junos Space applications offer 
predefined automation schemes and best practice templates 
to enable rapid and accurate configurations.

Junos SDK
Juniper offers a Junos Software Developer’s Kit (SDK) that 
enables users to create, deploy and validate innovative custom 
applications that run on top of the Junos operating system on 
EX Series switches, confirming the company’s commitment to 
software innovation through network programmability. Junos 
SDK simplifies the development and reuse of components for 
collaboration while the underlying Junos OS provides security, 
robustness and resiliency, creating a widespread platform for 
running network applications.

Network programmability itself, however, is not the goal, but 
the means towards greater innovation and an evolution of the 
network. In addition to creating SDKs, Juniper Networks is evolving 
its software systems to serve as platforms that will run network 
applications. The Junos SDK enables ease of development and 
reuse of components for collaboration, while the underlying Junos 
OS provides security, robustness, and resiliency to failure, and a 
widespread platform for application deployment.
