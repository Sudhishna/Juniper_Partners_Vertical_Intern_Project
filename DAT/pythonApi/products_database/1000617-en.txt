PTX10000 Packet  
Transport Router

Product Overview

Core networks must be able to 
handle exponential data growth 
and changing traffic patterns 
as applications move to clouds 
and data centers. Internet 
exchange providers, collocation 
facilities, and service providers 
of all types need platforms 
that can evolve quickly to 
meet changing demands while 
lowering operational costs. The 
PTX10000 is a family of next-
generation, data center-optimized 
modular routers that redefines 
per-slot economics, enabling 
customers to do more with less 
while simplifying network design 
and reducing OpEx. The chassis 
family shares a common set of 
components, while various line 
cards are available to satisfy 
specific core, edge routing, and 
switching applications.

 

Product Description 
Network traffic today is predominately cloud access, mobile, and video applications. Data 
center and network operators must provide connectivity services that are low latency, low 
delay, and with video, provide consistent packet delay variation. The pace of application 
change, and the speed at which devices can process data, mean operators must be able 
to upgrade quickly as needs arise. Operators must have the flexibility to offer new services, 
adjust performance, or explore new opportunities quickly, with confidence that the new 
services will have sufficient capacity to sustain exponential growth. 

Competing with the ability to rapidly expand capacity is the need to reduce operational 
costs. Providers are under enormous pressure to lower margins and compete with 
new entrants and disruptors that do not have legacy networks to maintain. Among the 
challenges they face:

•  Scale: Providers may offer backbone connectivity that requires a large number of 

label-switched paths (LSPs). If they are using RSVP to take advantage of the traffic 
engineering (RSVP-TE) functionality, the control plane signaling path must be able 
to scale in step with the growth of LSPs. This ability to scale is needed for both the 
primary and backup paths to support redundancy mechanisms like fast re-route 
(FRR). Today, the total number needed for backbone connectivity is a few million. 
This type of scaling challenge will be felt by operators who are trying to diversify their 
portfolios by adding a broader scope of connectivity options; for example, a data 
center operator who wants to provide cloud connectivity or VPN services to enterprise 
customers, or an operator of private line service who wants to add a collocation 
service to its offering. 

•  Operational Flexibility: Virtualized services and the explosion of cloud-based 

applications are creating increasingly erratic traffic patterns. To handle this 
unpredictability, service providers need architectures that are flexible and dynamic 
across all layers. A rigid architecture prevents programmable, predictable, and traffic-
optimized networks from supporting any service, anywhere.

•  Power Consumption: Power consumption is a variable cost. Hyper-scale data center 

operations have done much to improve the power efficiency of their applications 
and server operations. Multitenant data centers, collocation facilities, and service 
providers do not necessarily have the same ability to control all aspects of IT 
infrastructure and application design to dictate power utilization. Providers need 
systems designed to take advantage of advances in power usage improvements 
made in data center computing. Power efficiency is a key factor in reducing TCO. 

•  Space Limitations: Service providers can’t grow their physical plants forever. They 

need innovations like a low-touch deployment model optimized around space 
availability, facility power requirements, and floor weight thresholds. Efficiently scaling 
capacity in a small footprint is critical.

In order to address these challenges, service providers need a 
core router that delivers scale, operational efficiency, and SDN 
programmability. Juniper Networks® PTX Series Packet Transport 
Routers offer the industry’s only core router that exceeds these 
requirements while easily fitting into the service provider network, 
providing support for full peering, MPLS, and IP core routing (see 
Figure 1).

PTX10000 Packet Transport Routers
The Juniper Networks PTX10000 line of Packet Transport Routers 
brings physical and virtual innovations to the service provider core 
network. These next-generation routers directly address concerns 
about operational expenditures while scaling efficiently to keep 
pace with growing traffic demands. 

Innovations in the core silicon enable the PTX10000 routers to 
lower operational expenses. The PTX10000 line is powered by 
the highly scalable Juniper ExpressPlus custom silicon, providing 
consistently low latency and wire-rate packet performance 
for both IP traffic and MPLS transport without sacrificing the 
optimized system power profile. 

These concepts, along with full IP routing functionality, are 
at the center of the PTX10000 design, preserving the spirit 
of the original Junos Express chipset. ExpressPlus is the first 
purpose-built telecommunications silicon to build a 3D memory 
architecture into the base design, performing more than 1.6 
billion filter operations per second and dynamic table memory 
allocation for massive IP routing scale, while at the same time 
providing tremendous power efficiency gains. The ability to 
address a provider’s core networking requirements—scale, 
operational flexibility, and SDN control—begins with the silicon. 
With the PTX10000 line, operators can now deploy a core 
architecture with SDN control. Combining Juniper Networks 
NorthStar Controller, with a robust full-featured Internet 
backbone router, and a regional IP/MPLS core router with 

integrated 100GbE coherent transport for superior performance, 
operators can tune their network infrastructure through proactive 
monitoring and what-if planning capabilities. The NorthStar 
Controller dynamically creates explicit routing paths using a 
global view based on user-defined constraints. 

Scale is one of the guiding design principles for the PTX10000 
routers, empowering service providers with the ability to handle 
increased traffic demands smoothly. The PTX10000 line 
simplifies network engineering challenges with predictable 
system latency, improving the overall service experience by 
delivering best-in-class resiliency to ensure service providers 
meet strict customer service-level agreements (SLAs).

Operational efficiency is another design attribute for the 
PTX10000 line, focusing on power, space, and weight—
fundamental concerns that affect service providers’ operational 
budgets. Juniper has designed the PTX10000 to fit the 
requirements of today’s data center facilities.

SDN programmability brings virtual innovations to the service 
provider core, while the NorthStar Controller offers an open, 
standards-based solution that optimizes both the IP layer and 
the transport layer with precise SDN control, allowing service 
providers to automate and scale their operations. 

PTX10008 Packet Transport Router

Juniper Networks PTX10008 Packet Transport Router, the 
first member of the PTX10000 line, is the perfect core router 
for today’s space-constrained operations and data center 
facilities. It offers unprecedented capacity in a 13 U platform that 
supports 24 Tbps per chassis or 72 Tbps per standard 19-inch 
telecommunications rack—all at wire speed. Powered by Juniper’s 
custom ExpressPlus silicon, the PTX10008 delivers predictable 
IP/MPLS packet performance and functionality, eliminating the 
complex packet profiles found in elaborate, over engineered 
network processing units (NPUs) deployed in other core routers.

Data SheetPTX10000 Packet Transport RouterThe PTX10008 has eight slots, each supporting 3 Tbps. A fully 
equipped PTX10008 can support 240x100GbE interfaces in 
a single chassis. This enables service providers to build a core 
architecture that optimizes label-switching router (LSR), Internet 
backbone, peering, and optical convergence applications for 
small regional deployments. As a result, service providers can—
for the first time—match traffic demand with optimized core 
router performance and flexible deployments. With its ultra-
optimized and compact form factor, the PTX10008 is ideal for 
peering, collocation, and central office locations where space 
and power are at a premium. 

Architecture and Key Components
The PTX10000 line of routers features a number of architectural 
elements. The Routing Engines (REs) not only run Juniper 
Networks Junos® operating system, which processes all Layer 2 
and Layer 3 protocols, they also manage the chassis and provide 
switching functionality for data traffic coming from line cards. 

The PTX10000 line cards currently support 100/40/10GbE 
interfaces, and the system is designed to support 400GbE 
interfaces in the future. The horizontal line cards in the front of 
the chassis connect directly to the vertical switch fabric cards 
in the rear of the chassis via orthogonal interconnects without 
requiring a midplane. This provides unparalleled investment 
protection by ensuring a smooth upgrade path to higher speed 
switch fabric cards as they become available. The midplane-less 
design also improves airflow with a front-to-back design. 

To maintain uninterrupted operation, the PTX10000 fan trays 
cool the line cards and REs with redundant, variable-speed fans. 
In addition, the PTX10000 power supplies convert building power 
to the internal voltage required by the system. All PTX10000 
components are hot-swappable, and all central functions are 
available in redundant configurations, providing high operational 
availability by allowing continuous system operation during 
maintenance or repairs. The chassis also uses a universal design, 
allowing it to be used independently for core, edge, or switching 
configurations.

PTX10000 Hardware Components
The key hardware components of PTX10000 line of Packet 
Transport Routers are the line cards and REs. 

Line Cards

The line cards for the PTX10000 platforms are based on the 
highly scalable custom Juniper ExpressPlus silicon, making it 
the industry’s leading core router for MPLS, Internet backbone, 
peering, and transport integration applications. Each slot on the 
PTX10000 routers supports 3 Tbps, while the line cards support 
multirate 100GbE, 40GbE, and 10GbE. 

The modular design of the PTX10000 devices provides 
investment protection by allowing future upgrades. The Packet 
Forwarding Engines (PFEs) offer 500 Gbps of WAN and fabric 

bandwidth. To achieve 3 Tbps forwarding performance, a total 
of six PFEs are implemented on each interface card. The PFEs 
provide ingress queuing with loopback stream optimization to 
avoid reading and writing packet tails when packets are sent to 
and received back from a loopback stream. The line cards also 
provide Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) 
support with per-port Ethernet OAM counters, as well as packet 
memory, which uses Hybrid Memory Cube DRAM technology to 
reduce power usage, increase speed, and improve system density.

Routing Engine/Control Board Complex 

The Routing Engine and Control Board are combined on a 
single card. The RE is based on the Intel X86 architecture. Up to 
two REs can be installed in a PTX10000 chassis to provide 1+1 
redundancy. The RE features a quad-core 2.5 GHz Intel processor 
with 32 GB memory and 2x50 GB solid-state drive (SSD) storage.

Power

The PTX10000 routers contain six power supply slots to provide 
complete flexibility for provisioning and redundancy. Each power 
supply has its own internal fan for cooling. The PTX10000 line 
supports both AC and DC power supplies; however, AC and DC 
supplies cannot be mixed in the same chassis.

The AC supplies on the PTX10000 routers accept 200 to 240 
volts alternating current (VAC) input, and they deliver 2700 watts 
of power to the chassis. The DC power supplies accept -40 to -72 
volts direct current (VDC) input and deliver 2500 watts of power 
to the chassis. Each AC and DC power supply has two inputs for 
feed redundancy.

Cooling

The PTX10000 line modular chassis supports front-to-back 
cooling with air drawn in through the perforations on the REs and 
the line cards in the front of the platform. The fan trays are in 
front of the fabric cards and are accessible from the rear of the 
chassis. Hot air exhausts through the rear of the chassis. 

Chassis Management

The PTX10000 line delivers powerful Junos OS chassis 
management that allows environmental monitoring and field-
replaceable unit (FRU) control. Chassis management provides 
a faster primary switchover, enhanced power budgeting with a 
modular power management, reduced power consumption for 
partially populated systems, granular control over FRU power-
on, multizone cooling with better fan speed control for reduced 
noise, and CPU leveling during monitoring intervals.

Simplified Management

The PTX10000 line of routers simplifies management based 
on the elegance and simplicity of the Junos OS. Management 
applications can receive streaming telemetry data to provide 
robust protocol analytics for an SDN environment. Junos OS also 
supports OpenConfig, which today is a YANG-based data model 
that supports a variety of operator use cases.

services, consistent low latency, and wire-rate 
forwarding at scale, while providing the reliability 
needed to meet strict SLAs.

Source Packet Routing in Networking 
(SPRING) 

Junos OS supports SPRING, which provides the 
ability for a trusted source node to specify a 
forwarding path, other than the normal shortest 
path, that a particular packet will traverse.

High availability hardware

High availability software

The PTX10008 is engineered with full hardware 
redundancy for cooling, power supply, Routing 
Engines, and switch fabric.

PTX10008 routers feature a resilient operating 
system that supports HA features such as graceful 
RE switchover (GRES), nonstop active routing 
(NSR), and unified in-service software upgrade 
(unified ISSU) for high availability.
PTX Series routers support game-changing 50 ms 
redundancy switchover under load.

This delivers the distributed peering scale of 2.9 
million forwarding information base (FIB) and 30 
million routing information base (RIB) (also known 
as forwarding and routing tables, respectively), 
3000 OSPF adjacencies, and 4000 BGP sessions 
required to match expanding traffic demands.

This provides additional flexibility per packet 
source. It also adds features such as network path 
and node protection to support FRR mechanisms, 
enhanced network programmability, OAM 
functionality, simplified network signaling, load 
balancing, and traffic engineering functions.

High availability (HA) is a critical requirement 
for service providers to maintain an always-on 
infrastructure base to meet stringent SLAs across 
the core.

Junos OS supports HA features that allow 
software upgrades and changes without 
disrupting network traffic.
