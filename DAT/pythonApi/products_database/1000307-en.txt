Data SheetProduct Overview 
The Juniper Networks EX2200 line of Ethernet switches offers 
a compact, high-performance solution for supporting today’s 
converged network access deployments.

Each EX2200 switch includes an application-specific integrated 
circuit (ASIC)-based Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) with an 
integrated CPU to consistently deliver wire-rate forwarding, even 
with all control plane features enabled. Based on existing, field 
proven Juniper Networks technology, the PFE brings the same 
level of carrier-class performance and reliability to the EX2200 
switches that Juniper Networks routers bring to the world’s 
largest service provider networks.

Architecture and Key Components
The EX2200 occupies a single rack unit, delivering a compact 
solution for crowded wiring closets and access locations where 
space and power are at a premium. The EX2200 switch’s 10-
inch depth and low acoustics also make it ideal for open office 
deployments.

Each EX2200 switch supports four fixed front panel GbE uplink 
ports with pluggable optics (purchased separately) for high-
speed backbone or link aggregation connections between wiring 
closets and upstream aggregation switches. The EX2200 also 
features a front panel mode button that offers a simple interface 
for bringing devices up and selecting LED modes.

A dedicated rear panel RJ-45 Ethernet port is available for out-of-
band management, while a rear panel USB port can be used to 
easily upload the Junos operating system and configuration files.

Data SheetEX2200 Ethernet SwitchVirtual Chassis Technology
The EX2200 supports Juniper’s unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, enabling up to four interconnected EX2200 switches 
to be managed as a single logical device, delivering a scalable, 
pay-as-you-grow solution for expanding network environments. 

While EX2200 switches can be interconnected over any of the 
front-panel uplink ports, the last two ports are configured by 
default as Virtual Chassis ports, automating deployments when 
using standard  GbE SFP transceivers (sold separately). These 
two ports can also be configured as GbE uplinks to aggregation 
devices by disabling the Virtual Chassis technology.

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2200 
switches elect a master and a backup switch based on a 
set of preconfigured policies or criteria. The master switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all other Virtual Chassis switch members.  
Switches can be added to or removed from the Virtual Chassis 
configuration without service disruption. 

EX2200 Virtual Chassis configurations operate as highly resilient 
unified systems, providing simplified management using a single 
IP address, single telnet session, single command-line interface 
(CLI), automatic version checking, and automatic configuration. 
The EX2200 switches are also capable of local switching, so 
packets coming into a port destined for another port on the same 
switch do not have to traverse the Virtual Chassis, increasing 
forwarding capacities.

EX2200 Virtual Chassis configurations implement the same slot/
module/port numbering schema as other Juniper Networks chassis-
based products, providing true chassis-like operations. By using 
a consistent operating system and a single configuration file, all 
switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration are treated as a single 

device, simplifying overall system maintenance and management.

Data SheetEX2200 Ethernet SwitchFeatures and Benefits
High Availability Features

•  Redundant Trunk Group (RTG): To avoid the complexities 

of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) without sacrificing 
network resiliency, the EX2200 employs a redundant 
trunk group to provide the necessary port redundancy and 
simplify switch configuration.

•  Power resiliency through external redundant power supply: 
The EX2200 supports an optional redundant power supply 
(RPS) unit which provides power resiliency.

Junos Operating System

The EX2200 runs the same Junos OS used by other Juniper 
Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well as all of Juniper’s 
routers and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways. 
By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. To maintain that consistency, Junos 
OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process that 
uses a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression-tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version; customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

Converged Environments

The EX2200 provides the highest levels of flexibility and features 
in its class for the most demanding converged data, voice, and 
video environments, delivering a reliable platform for unifying 
enterprise communications.

By providing a full 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE to VoIP telephones, 
closed-circuit security cameras, wireless access points, and other 
IP-enabled devices, the EX2200 delivers a future proofed solution 
for converging disparate networks onto a single IP infrastructure. 
The EX2200 PoE switches also support 802.3at standards-
based PoE+ for powering networked devices like multiple radio 
IEEE 802.11n wireless access points, and video phones that may 
require more power than available with IEEE 802.3af.

To ease deployment, the EX2200 supports the industry-standard 
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media Endpoint 
Discovery (LLDP-MED) protocol, enabling the switches to 
automatically discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their 
power requirements, and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) membership.  
LLDP-MED-based granular PoE management allows the EX2200 
to negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on powered 
devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across the switch.

In addition, the EX2200 supports rich quality-of-service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The 
switches support eight class-of-service (CoS) queues on every 
port, enabling them to maintain multilevel, end-to-end traffic 
prioritizations. The EX2200 also support a wide range of policy 
options, including strict priority, low-latency, and shaped deficit 
weighted round-robin (SDWRR) queuing.

Security

The EX2200 fully integrates with Juniper Networks Unified Access 
Control, which consolidates all aspects of a user’s identity, device, 
and location. This enables administrators to enforce access 
control and security down to the individual port or user levels. 

Working as an enforcement point within UAC, the EX2200 
provides both standards-based 802.1X port-level access 
control for multiple devices per port, as well as Layer 2-4 policy 
enforcement based on user identity, location, and/or device. A 
user’s identity, device type, machine posture check, and location 
can be used to determine whether access should be granted and 
for how long. If access is granted, the switch assigns the user’s 
device to a specific VLAN based on authorization policy. The 
switch can also apply security policies, QoS policies, or both, or it 
can mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring, 
or threat detection by intrusion prevention systems.

The EX2200 also provides a full complement of integrated 
port security and threat detection features, including Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping, Dynamic ARP 
Inspection (DAI), and media access control (MAC) limiting to 
defend against internal and external spoofing, man-in-the-
middle and denial of service (DoS) attacks.

Data SheetEX2200 Ethernet SwitchJunos Space
Juniper also offers a comprehensive suite of network 
management tools that provide a smart, simple, and open 
approach for automating the deployment and operation of a 
Juniper infrastructure. 

These tools are based on a single network application platform 
called Juniper Networks Junos® Space, an open, programmable 
application platform for hosting network infrastructure and 
operational applications across the entire management life 
cycle of the network. Explicitly designed to allow partners and 
customers to build and deploy smart, simple, and easy-to-
use applications, Junos Space provides multiple management 
and infrastructure applications for managing Juniper resources 
and assets, including inventory management, device and 
interface configuration, automated software management 
and deployment, and event-driven fault management. These 
platform applications are embedded within the core product, 
allowing users to control any part of their environment when 
used in conjunction with multiple add-on applications. Junos 
Space will support a full portfolio of applications for automating 
network infrastructure and operations covering the campus LAN 
and data center network environments.

Designed to automate the configuration, visualization, monitoring, 
and administration of large switch and router networks, these 
Junos Space applications offer predefined automation schemes 
and best practice templates to enable rapid and accurate 
deployments. When managing a group of EX2200 switches, 
the Junos Space platform and associated applications provide 
network-level management across all Juniper Networks switches 
from a single console.

Simplified Management and Operations

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX2200 
dramatically simplifies network management.  Up to four 
interconnected EX2200 switches can be managed as a single 
device utilizing a single Junos OS image file and a single 
configuration file, reducing the overall number of units to monitor 
and manage. When the Junos OS is upgraded on the master 
switch in an EX2200 Virtual Chassis configuration, the software 
is automatically upgraded on all other member switches at the 
same time.

The EX2200 includes port profiles that allow network 
administrators to automatically configure ports with security, 
QoS, and other parameters based on the type of device 
connected to the port. Six preconfigured profiles are available, 
including default, desktop, desktop plus IP phone, WLAN access 
point, routed uplink, and Layer 2 uplink. Users can select from 
the existing profiles or create their own and apply them through 
the command-line interface (CLI), J-Web Software interface, or 
management system.

In addition, a feature called system snapshot makes a copy of 
all software files used to run the switch—including the Junos 
operating system, the active configuration and the rescue 
configuration—that can be used to reboot the switch at the next 
power-up or as a backup boot option.  The Junos OS software 
can also be pre-installed on a flash drive and used to boot the 
EX2200 at any time.

Another feature, called automatic software download, enables 
network administrators to easily upgrade the EX2200 using 
the DHCP message exchange process to download and install 
software packages.  Users simply configure the automatic 
software download feature on EX2200 switches acting as DHCP 
clients and establish a path to the server where the software 
package file is installed.  The server then communicates the path 
to the software package file through DHCP server messages.

An EZ touchless provisioning feature allows a DHCP server to 
push configuration details and software images to multiple 
switches at bootup.

Three system management options are available for the EX2200 
line. The standard Junos OS CLI management interface offers 
the same granular capabilities and scripting parameters found in 
any router powered by the Junos operating system. The EX2200 
also includes the integrated J-Web interface, an embedded web-
based device manager that allows users to configure, monitor, 
troubleshoot, and perform system maintenance on individual 
switches via a browser-based graphical interface. 

Finally, EX2200 fault, configuration, and performance data can be 
exported to leading third-party management systems such as HP 
OpenView, IBM Tivoli, and Computer Associates Unicenter software, 
providing a complete, consolidated view of network operations.
