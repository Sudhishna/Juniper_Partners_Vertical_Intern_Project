Client Optics for PTX Series,  
MX Series, and ACX Series Platforms

Product Overview 

The relentless traffic growth 
driven by mobile, video, BYOD, 
and cloud-based services is 
straining traditional networks 
and negatively impacting the 
businesses that rely on them. 
Emerging Internet of Things 
(IoT) communications promise 
even greater challenges in the 
near future. Given these realities, 
there is a renewed focus on 
client optics integrated directly 
on routing elements, which can 
streamline network design and 
operations and help contain total 
cost of network ownership. 

Product Description 
From the Juniper Networks® ACX Series Universal Access Routers for access and 
aggregation, to the MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers and PTX Series Packet Transport 
Routers, Juniper’s routing platforms support multiple application interface types and 
technologies. A variety of optic module options are available for these platforms, including 
pluggable that can be selected based on distance, form factor, and wavelength. Identifying 
the best optic module for a particular use case depends on the architecture, network 
topology, and business imperatives. 

Features and Benefits
Integrated client optics deliver the following benefits:

•  Help service providers keep pace with ever-increasing network traffic, streamline 

network design and operations, and contain TCO. 

•  Eliminate the need for service providers to source and deploy optical equipment and 

IP/MPLS routers separately

•  Reduce the number of management touch points up to four times 

•  Simplify operations by allowing optical and IP/MPLS to be deployed together

Product Options
Client optics options are detailed in the following tables. To make the best choices, review 
the Line Card Pluggable Client Optics tables, locate the proper client optics pluggable 
interface, and review the Pluggable Optics Specifications table to validate that the 
selected optic meets your specified network needs. Alternatively, you can review the Client 
Optics table, find a match based on your needs (such as distance), and then review what 
line card options are available with the specific optics pluggable interface.
