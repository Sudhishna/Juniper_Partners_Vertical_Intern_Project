Product Description 
Juniper Networks® Cloud CPE solution automates the creation and the delivery of network 
services with agility at scale, enabling service providers to deliver innovative managed 
services from the data center or at the customer edge. While traditional customer premises 
equipment (CPE) devices have served the market well for years, they do not provide the 
flexibility, agility, or scalability required for a flexible cloud deployment model. As a result, 
service providers typically employ diverse proprietary and closed platforms that inhibit 
innovation and complicate configuration, provisioning, and management.

More than ever, enterprises rely on the Internet to support their business operations. This 
increasing dependence on the Internet to access geographically distributed data centers 
and the multitude of mission-critical cloud-based applications has made branch offices 
complex to manage, maintain, and upgrade. Rapid business expansions, both local and 
international, also create new challenges for branch office deployment and connectivity. 
Enterprises require a solution that creates branches on demand, accelerates service 
deployment, and instantly applies business updates and security policies consistently 
across a diverse and growing number of business applications and branch locations. 

Juniper Networks NFX250 Network Services Platform eliminates the challenges associated 
with deploying, managing, maintaining, and evolving CPE. Leveraging Network Functions 
Virtualization (NFV) and built on the Juniper Cloud CPE solution, the NFX250 is a highly 
scalable solution empowering enterprise customers to deploy multiple secure and high-
performance virtual network functions (VNFs) on premises. The NFX250 also serves 
as a reliable, scalable, and secure network service platform to rapidly deploy virtual 
routing services, as well as a Juniper Cloud-Enabled Branch solution. This automated, 
software-driven solution dynamically provisions new services on demand, resulting in a 
near instantaneous service delivery experience. Subsequent service updates and policy 
changes can be consistently and dynamically inserted into the existing device, resulting 
in operational efficiency for service providers and enterprise customers alike by limiting or 
even eliminating service interruptions and business disruptions. 

The embedded SD-WAN functionality supports advanced routing features, augmenting 
enterprise WANs beyond the traditional MPLS. Advanced policy-driven security features 
by Juniper Networks vSRX virtual firewall hosted on the NFX250 provides optimal routing 
for applications through the MPLS or broadband connection determined by predefined 
policies while ensuring secure protection across the entire enterprise network and 
distributed branches. 

The NFX250 also embeds the Juniper Networks vMX Virtual Router, a full-featured, carrier-
grade MX Series 3D Universal Edge Router that extends more than 15 years of Juniper edge 
routing expertise to the virtual realm.  The vMX delivers complete feature and operational 
consistency with physical MX Series platforms, providing sophisticated routing services in 
support of provider edge and customer premises equipment (CPE) applications. With its 
granular “pay as you grow” licensing model, the vMX allows users to start small, move fast, 
and stay profitable.

Service Orchestration is a comprehensive management and 
orchestration solution that delivers VNFs to the NFX250. 
A simple GUI customer portal gives enterprise customers 
the flexibility to select and build customized services 
from a catalog. Contrail Service Orchestration automates 
service activation and provisions newly requested services 
instantaneously under an open NFV environment. 

Features and Benefits
Cloud Adoption 

Unlike traditional CPE devices that inhibit agility, the NFX250 is 
highly scalable, supporting multiple concurrent VNFs on a single 
device. This substantially reduces upfront CapEx and software 
costs, establishing a flexible consumption model for on-demand 
network services from the cloud. 

Cost Efficiencies

The NFX250 improves the overall cost efficiency of the Cloud-
Enabled Branch and managed services with Cloud CPE. CapEx 
efficiency is enhanced where a single and scalable NFX250 
replaces multiple on-premise devices. OpEx efficiency is achieved 
through automation, which simplifies operations and eliminates 
the extensive manual processes required by traditional CPE 
devices. Cost efficiencies help enterprise customers achieve 
operational agility and boost profitability.  

Security and Reliability

The NFX250 incorporates many advanced security features. The 
Secure Boot feature ensures that only an authentic, unmodified 
Juniper OS can be launched at boot time, safeguarding system 
integrity from factory to the branch site. The embedded Trusted 
Platform Module (TPM) ensures platform integrity and provides 
entropy for cryptographic operations.

•  Network Service Activator: The Network Service Activator 

application intelligently automates service life-cycle 
management on the NFX250 across managed VPN 
networks, in-region secured Internet connections, and out-
of-region IPsec connections. Automation eliminates complex 
manual intervention and improves overall operational 
efficiency while reducing the time to activate a customer. 

As a VNF for the NFX250, the vSRX provides the same 
capabilities as Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways 
in a virtual form factor, providing perimeter security, IPsec 
connectivity, applications detection, and filtering for malicious 
traffic without sacrificing reliability, visibility, or policy control. The
