SRX300 Line of Services  
Gateways for the Branch

Product Overview

The SRX300 line of services 
gateways combines security, 
routing, switching, and WAN 
interfaces with next-generation 
firewall and advanced threat 
mitigation capabilities for cost-
effective, secure connectivity 
across distributed enterprise 
locations. By consolidating fast, 
highly available switching, routing, 
security, and next-generation 
firewall capabilities in a single 
device, enterprises can remove 
network complexity, protect and 
prioritize their resources, and 
improve user and application 
experience while lowering total 
cost of ownership (TCO). 

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® SRX300 line of services gateways delivers a next-generation 
networking and security solution that supports the changing needs of cloud-enabled 
enterprise networks. Whether rolling out new services and applications across locations, 
connecting to the cloud, or trying to achieve operational efficiency, the SRX300 line helps 
organizations realize their business objectives while providing scalable, easy to manage, 
secure connectivity and advanced threat mitigation capabilities. Next-generation firewall 
and unified threat management (UTM) capabilities also make it easier to detect and 
proactively mitigate threats to improve the user and application experience.

The SRX300 line consists of four models:

•  SRX300: Securing small branch or retail offices, the SRX300 Services Gateway 

consolidates security, routing, switching, and WAN connectivity in a small desktop 
device. The SRX300 supports up to 1 Gbps firewall and 300 Mbps IPsec VPN in a 
single, consolidated, cost-effective networking and security platform.

•  SRX320: Securely connecting small distributed enterprise branch offices, the SRX320 

Services Gateway consolidates security, routing, switching, and WAN connectivity in 
a small desktop device. The SRX320 supports up to 1 Gbps firewall and 300 Mbps 
IPsec VPN in a single, consolidated, cost-effective networking and security platform.

•  SRX340: Securely connecting midsize distributed enterprise branch offices, the 

SRX340 Services Gateway consolidates security, routing, switching, and WAN 
connectivity in a 1 U form factor. The SRX340 supports up to 3 Gbps firewall and  
600 Mbps IPsec VPN in a single, consolidated, cost-effective networking and security 
platform.

•  SRX345: Best suited for midsize to large distributed enterprise branch offices, the SRX345 

Services Gateway consolidates security, routing, switching, and WAN connectivity in a 1 
U form factor. The SRX345 supports up to 5 Gbps firewall and 800 Mbps IPsec VPN in a 
single, consolidated, cost-effective networking and security platform.

SRX300 Highlights
The SRX300 line of services gateways consists of secure routers that bring high 
performance and proven deployment capabilities to enterprises that need to build a 
worldwide network of thousands of remote sites. Ethernet, serial, T1/E1, ADSL2/2+, 
VDSL2, and 3G/4G LTE wireless are all available options for WAN or Internet connectivity 
to link sites. Industry best, high-performance IPsec VPN solutions provide comprehensive 
encryption and authentication capabilities to secure intersite communications. Multiple 
form factors with Ethernet switching support on native Gigabit Ethernet ports allow cost-
effective choices for mission-critical deployments. Juniper Networks Junos® automation 
and scripting capabilities and Junos Space Security Director reduce operational complexity 
and simplify the provisioning of new sites.

Data SheetThe SRX300 line of devices recognizes more than 3,500 Layer 
3-7 applications, including Web 2.0 and evasive peer-to-peer 
(P2P) applications like Skype, torrents, and others. Correlating 
application information with user contextual information, the 
SRX300 line can generate bandwidth usage reports, enforce 
access control policies, prioritize and rate-limit traffic going 
out of WAN interfaces, and proactively secure remote sites. 
This optimizes resources in the branch office and improves the 
application and user experience. 

For the perimeter, the SRX300 line offers a comprehensive 
suite of application security services, threat defenses, and 
intelligence services. The services consist of intrusion prevention 
system (IPS), application security user role-based firewall 
controls, and on-box and cloud-based antivirus, anti-spam, and 
enhanced Web filtering, protecting networks from the latest 
content-borne threats. Integrated threat intelligence via Juniper 
Networks Spotlight Secure offers adaptive threat protection 

Features and Benefits

against Command and Control (C&C)-related botnets and policy 
enforcement based on GeoIP. Customers can also leverage their 
own custom and third-party feeds for protection from advanced 
malware and other threats. Integrating the Juniper Networks Sky 
Advanced Threat Protection solution, the SRX300 line detects 
and enforces automated protection against known malware and 
zero-day threats with a very high degree of accuracy.

The SRX300 line enables agile SecOps through automation 
capabilities that support Zero Touch Deployment, Python scripts 
for orchestration, and event scripting for operational management.

SRX300 services gateways run Juniper Networks Junos operating 
system, a proven, carrier-hardened network OS that powers 
the top 100 service provider networks around the world. The 
rigorously tested, carrier-class, rich routing features such as IPv4/
IPv6, OSPF, BGP, and multicast have been proven in over 15 years 
of worldwide deployments.
