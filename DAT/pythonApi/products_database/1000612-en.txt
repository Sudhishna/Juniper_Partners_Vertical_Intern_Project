NorthStar JumpStart

Service Overview 

NorthStar Controller is a powerful 
and flexible traffic engineering 
solution that provides granular 
visibility into and control over 
IP/MPLS flows in large service 
provider and enterprise networks.  
It enables network operators 
to dynamically optimize their 
network infrastructure through 
proactive monitoring, planning, 
and explicit routing of large 
traffic loads based on specified 
constraints.

The NorthStar JumpStart 
service is part of an overall set 
of services designed to enable 
the rapid adoption and use of 
Juniper’s core software products. 
Upon completion, you will have 
implemented a ready-to-use 
NorthStar Controller solution 
with expert knowledge transfer, 
enabling your operations teams 
to leverage its core value in your 
environment.   

Service Description
Deploying new, cutting-edge technologies and products can be challenging, given the 
varying degrees of complexity inherent in a continuously evolving environment.

In addition, operations and engineering teams are under tremendous pressure to quickly 
deliver results and secure the enterprise. They are expected to gain the necessary 
expertise and perform initial deployments and validation within a very short timescale, 
and the learning curve is typically very steep. 

The Juniper Networks® NorthStar JumpStart service is ideally positioned to relieve the 
initial implementation and configuration burden on operations and engineering teams, 
while determining whether any additional steps are required to deploy the solution in a 
production environment.

The service is performed by a highly skilled Juniper Networks Professional Services 
consultant as part of a combined remote and onsite delivery. Depending on your 
organization’s needs and level of expertise, the JumpStart service should be sufficient; 
for more complex implementations, additional services can be purchased based on your 
specific needs and operational environment.

The JumpStart service is based on a NorthStar standard reference architecture delivered 
by a Professional Services consultant following the Best Practices Playbook approach 
for consistency. The best practices are based on extensive deployment experience and 
expertise derived across customer deployments of all shapes and sizes.

The core of the service is an Implementation phase based on an initial prequalification 
activity to determine the necessary installation and configuration parameters required for 
deployment. This information is captured in an Implementation Plan and approved by key 
stakeholders prior to deployment and verification in the production environment.

Knowledge Transfer and Post Installation Support are included to ensure that there are no 
outstanding issues and the transfer to your organization goes smoothly.

Juniper’s Professional Services consultants have vast experience in customer and best-
practice implementation services that can save your operation and engineering teams 
time and effort, allowing them to focus on their key responsibilities.

The JumpStart service consists of three main phases: Implementation, Knowledge 
Transfer, and Post Installation Support. Typical durations for each phase in the NorthStar 
JumpStart service are shown in Figure 1.

Description

The Implementation phase consists of the following key activities:
• 

 Prequalification: Prequalification is a remote task designed to gain key deployment and configuration 
parameters as well as details specific to the customer’s environment necessary for the implementation.
 Implementation Plan: The Implementation Plan is executed remotely based on input from the 
prequalification activity and is used in deployment and verification execution.

• 

•  Deployment and Verification: Deployment provides an onsite installation of NorthStar Controller based 

on the Implementation Plan. Installation is performed by a Juniper Professional Services consultant, 
followed by onsite verification that everything is working properly.

Knowledge Transfer

•  Knowledge Transfer takes place throughout the onsite engagement with the appropriate end-

user personnel, delivering maximum value where there is continuous participation by the end user 
(operations and engineering). This phase covers exactly how the solution has been installed and 
configured in the customer environment and how it can be extended further.

Post Installation Support

•  This phase provides up to two days of Post Installation Support by the Juniper Professional Services 

consultant over a period of 15 days, giving customers a safety net as they accept the solution into 
operational use.

service

Scope

This service is based on the latest relevant 
release of NorthStar Controller covering a single 
NorthStar server, 10 PCEP nodes running Juniper 
Networks Junos® operating system, and two 
topology acquired devices.

The JumpStart service enables the rapid deployment and 
adoption of an initial NorthStar Controller implementation. For 
more complex environments, an Assessment service is offered 
that will help customers determine up front the best deployment 
path for their specific needs, which in turn may lead to 
JumpStart services. In cases where there is a need for additional 
customization with broader implementation and integration 
requirements for the target environment, the Assessment service 
may lead to more specialized implementation services.

NorthStar Controller

Streamline operations

Because Juniper Professional Services does the heavy li(cid:129)ing
to implement the solution, you increase operational e(cid:143)ciency 
and reduce overall OpEx, freeing your sta  to focus on core IT 
and network functions that provide business value.

Minimize risk

Managing the deployment requires solid planning and the application of industry 
best practices to ensure that the project progresses smoothly. Based on years of 
experience, the Juniper Project Management Methodology (JPMM) provides a 
foundation for managing and controlling of projects as well as a process for 
identifying and mitigating risk.
