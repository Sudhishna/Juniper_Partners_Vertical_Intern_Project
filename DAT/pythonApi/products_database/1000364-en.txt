PTX5000 and PTX3000 
Packet Transport Routers

Product Overview

Increased interactions between 
people and machines are 
creating a deluge of traffic, 
with increasingly unpredictable 
patterns. These dynamics have 
intensified the challenge to meet 
growth with traditional network 
products and architectures. A new 
approach, based on both physical 
and virtual innovations, is required 
to help service providers stay 
ahead of growing traffic demands 
while remaining profitable. Juniper 
Networks PTX Series Packet 
Transport Routers with custom 
ExpressPlus Silicon, built from 
the ground up with SDN in mind, 
provide service providers with a 
Converged Supercore architecture 
that reduces TCO with highly 
flexible, high-performance, and 
deployability innovations.

Product Description 
New traffic dynamics like mobility, video, and cloud-based services are transforming 
traditional network patterns and topologies. Stratified, statically designed and manually 
operated networks must evolve to meet demands quickly and economically. Many 
operators have seen profitability stagnate and total cost of ownership (TCO) grow under 
the burden that growing traffic demands are imposing. Service providers need to become 
more agile in order to optimize their existing network resources, shorten planning cycles, 
and remove rigid network layers. 

•  Static scale: The service provider backbone handles the entire weight of the network’s 

traffic. Therefore, it is paramount that the core network grows organically, along with 
the traffic. The silicon, system, and SDN innovations for the core empower service 
providers to scale faster than the traffic demands themselves in an elegant, elastic, 
redundant package—without requiring forklift upgrades.

•  Static architecture: Virtualized services and the explosion of cloud-based applications 

are creating traffic patterns that are increasingly unpredictable. To handle this 
unpredictability, service providers need their architectures to be flexible and dynamic 
across all layers. A rigid architecture hinders rather than enables programmable, 
predictable, and traffic-optimized networks supporting any service, anywhere.

•  Power challenges: For service providers, the operational cost to transmit a bit through 
the core is far exceeded by the power requirements to move that bit. Service providers 
have determined that the total power draw over a few years exceeds the total cost of 
deploying the network infrastructure. Efficient core router power utilization requires a 
holistic ground-up engineering approach. 

•  Facility challenges: Service providers cannot continue growing their facilities 

exponentially. They need innovations that provide a low-touch deployment model 
optimized around space availability, facility power requirements, and floor weight 
thresholds. Transport-oriented central office locations have the added requirement of 
European Telecommunications Standardization Institute (ETSI) standard depth, and 
any packet transport innovation must fit these constraints. 

In order to address these challenges, service providers need an innovative core router that 
delivers three defining principles: performance, deployability, and SDN programmability. 
With Juniper Networks® PTX Series Packet Transport Routers, Juniper is introducing the 
industry’s only core router that exceeds these requirements and easily fits into the service 
provider network, expanding the Juniper Networks Converged Supercore® architecture 
beyond lean LSR deployment, as shown in Figure 1.

PTX Series
The PTX Series Packet Transport Routers bring physical and 
virtual innovations to the service provider core network that 
directly address concerns about operational expenditures while 
scaling organically to keep pace with growing traffic demands. 
In order for PTX Series routers to lower operational expenses, 
physical innovations at the core silicon are needed. PTX Series 
routers are powered by Juniper Networks ExpressPlus™ Silicon, 
building upon the Juniper Networks Junos Express silicon concepts 
of low consistent latency and wire-rate packet performance 
for both IP traffic and MPLS transport without sacrificing the 
optimized system power profile. All of these concepts are 
incorporated into the design along with full IP functionality, 
preserving the spirit of the original Junos Express chipset. The 
ExpressPlus Silicon is the first purpose-built telecommunication 
silicon to engineer a 3D memory architecture into the base design 
for over 1.6 billion filter operations per second, dynamic table 
memory allocation for mammoth IP routing scale, and enormous 
power efficiency gains. The ability to address service provider 
core networking requirements of performance, deployability, and 
SDN control begins with the silicon. The integration of optical 
transport with 100GbE coherent technology further improves the 
economics of both metro and core networks. With PTX Series 
routers powered by the Juniper ExpressPlus Silicon, service 
providers can now deploy a Converged Supercore architecture 
with the efficiency of a lean core deployment with Juniper 
Networks NorthStar Controller SDN control, a robust full-featured 
Internet backbone router, and a converged regional IP/MPLS core 
router with integrated 100GbE coherent transport for superior 
performance, elegant deployment, and SDN programmability.

Performance is one of the guiding design principles for the PTX 
Series routers. This focus empowers service providers with superior 
scale to match increased traffic demands and simplified network 
engineering challenges with predictable system latency to improve 

the overall service experience and best in-class resiliency to ensure 
that service providers meet strict customer SLAs.

Deployability is the other guiding design principle for the PTX 
Series routers that focuses on power, space, and weight—
fundamental concerns that impact the service providers’ 
operational budget with respect to growing traffic demands.

SDN programmability brings virtual innovations to the service 
provider core, while the Juniper Networks NorthStar Controller 
is an open, standards-based solution that optimizes both the IP 
layer and the transport layer with precise SDN control, allowing 
service providers to automate and scale operations. 

PTX5000
The Juniper Networks PTX5000 Packet Transport Router 
transforms the core network with physical and virtual innovations 
for unprecedented scale and cost. Service providers now have 
the freedom to create new virtualized services anywhere in the 
network and elastically create a Converged Supercore architecture 
with precise traffic control without sacrificing the service 
experience. The PTX5000, for the first time, lets service providers 
seamlessly scale IP/MPLS traffic without sacrificing performance 
and deployability, the contributors to eroding TCO analysis for 
service providers. The PTX5000 focus is on the Converged 
Supercore architecture for service providers, which is optimized 
for LSR, Internet backbone, peering, and dense 100 Gbps optical-
coherent DWDM applications for large, high-speed, massive-
scale networks. As such, for the first time, service providers can 
match traffic demand with optimized core router performance 
and deployability. The PTX5000, the only core router that can 
be deployed in a standard 19-inch telecommunications rack, 
stands 36U high with eight line-card slots, two redundant route 
engine slots, and nine switch fabric slots. At 3 Tbps per line-card 
slot, the PTX5000 supports 24 Tbps of total system capacity. 
Powered by the Juniper ExpressPlus Silicon, the PTX5000 offers 

2

Data SheetPTX5000 and PTX3000 Packet Transport Routerspredictable IP/MPLS packet performance and functionality, 
eliminating the complex sawtooth packet profile found in 
elaborate overengineered NPUs deployed in other core routers. 
The PTX5000 supports 240 x 100GbE interfaces (in QSFP28 optic 
form factors) in a single chassis, delivering the scale required to 
match expanding traffic demand.

The PTX5000 also supports the industry’s densest 100GbE-
coherent DWDM linecard with 1 Tbps capacity, blending best-
of-class IP/MPLS performance with optical transport to flatten 
network layers.

PTX3000
In many countries, as well as smaller central offices and lower 
bandwidth applications, the Juniper Networks PTX3000 
Packet Transport Router is the perfect Converged Supercore 
router. The PTX3000 brings unprecedented capacity in a 22U 
package that supports 8 Tbps per chassis or 16 Tbps per one 
standard 19-inch telecommunications rack, all at wire-rate 
performance. Powered by custom Juniper ExpressPlus Silicon, 
the PTX3000, like the PTX5000, delivers predictable IP/MPLS 
packet performance and functionality, eliminating the complex 
sawtooth packet profile found in elaborate over-engineered 
NPUs deployed in other core routers.

The PTX3000 is the only Converged Supercore platform that 
complies with 300 mm ETSI standards for both transport and 
space-constrained central office environments, making it the 
most globally deployable core router on the market. It supports 
up to 8 FPCs, each of which supports one PIC. The PTX3000 can 
support 80 x 100GbE interfaces in a single chassis, with support 
for gray and coherent optic technology. The PTX3000 enables 
service providers to build a Converged Supercore architecture 
that optimizes LSR, Internet backbone, peering, and optical 
convergence applications for smaller regional deployments. 
As such, for the first time, service providers can match traffic 
demand with optimized core router performance and flexible 
deployments. With its ultra-optimized form factor, the PTX3000 
is ideally positioned for space-constrained colocation facilities 
such as optical transport environments, central office locations 
in emerging markets where space and power are at a premium, 
smaller service providers wanting Converged Supercore 
advantages, and next-generation metro regional networks. 

Architecture and Key Components
New and emerging traffic dynamics like mobility, video, and 
cloud-based services are transforming traditional network 
patterns and topologies. Networks that are stratified, statically 
designed and manually operated must adapt to meet demands 
quickly and more economically. Many operators have seen 
profitability stagnate and TCO grow under the weight of growing 
traffic demands. 

In anticipation of increasingly unpredictable traffic patterns and 
volumes, many service providers overprovision their infrastructure 
months in advance. This requires considerable capital outlay 
for equipment that largely sits idle. This financial imbalance is 

unsustainable. Instead, operators need to become more agile to 
optimize existing network resources, shorten planning cycles, and 
remove rigid network layers. Once this is done, service providers can 
leverage a highly intelligent Converged Supercore infrastructure to 
increase revenues by creating new customizable services.

Juniper Networks Converged Supercore architecture, shown in 
Figure 1, is composed of Converged Supercore LSR, Converged 
Supercore IP Backbone, Transport Integration, Juniper Networks 
Junos Space Network Management Platform, and NorthStar 
Controller for SDN Programmability. 

•  The Converged Supercore LSR enables service providers 
to leverage the heart of the core MPLS backbone with a 
scalable, cost-optimized network.

•  The Converged Supercore IP Backbone expands the 

architecture to address additional applications such as 
Internet backbone, Internet peering, infrastructure edge, 
back-end data center interconnect and metro-regional 
cores, fully collapsing IP with optical transport. A wide 
breadth of applications are available to service providers with 
Converged Supercore architectures, helping them achieve 
industry-low TCO and scaling each application organically as 
demand dictates.

•  Junos Space Network Management Platform provides 

comprehensive management across the Converged 
Supercore architecture with broad fault, configuration, 
accounting, performance, and security management 
(FCAPS) capabilities; same-day support for new Junos OS 
releases; a task-specific user interface; and northbound APIs 
for integrating with existing network management systems 
(NMS) or operations/business support systems (OSS/BSS). 

•  NorthStar Controller, the industry-first traffic optimization 
SDN controller which lets service providers automate and 
engineer traffic across their SDN, increases utilization while 
reducing redundancy. Combining the power of Junos OS, 
WANDL optimization algorithms, and transport abstraction, 
NorthStar Controller enables Converged Supercore design 
across all networking layers, runtime traffic optimization, 
and “what-if” analysis. The result—new levels of control and 
visibility that help you avoid costly overprovisioning. 

PTX Series Hardware Components
The key hardware components of PTX Series Packet Transport 
Routers are the FPC, PIC, Routing Engine (RE), and Switch 
Interface Board (SIB).  

FPC and PIC

The first-generation and second-generation FPC line cards 
for the PTX5000 are based on the Junos Express chipset, 
making the PTX5000 the industry’s leading core router for 
LSR applications. Introducing the third-generation FPC line 
card for the PTX5000, based on custom Juniper ExpressPlus 
Silicon, expands the PTX5000’s application scope, making it 
the leading core router for LSR, Internet backbone, peering, and 
transport integration. The modular FPC design for the PTX5000

between generations of FPCs and deploying different PIC types 
simultaneously in a single FPC.

and the other acting as the standby ready to take over in case 
of failure. The RE communicates with the CB via a pair of 10GbE 
links and a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus. 

The first generation small form-factor FPC line card for the 
PTX3000 is based upon the Junos Express chipset, making the 
PTX3000 the industry’s leading space-constrained core router 
for LSR applications. Introducing the third-generation FPC line 
card for the PTX3000, based on custom Juniper ExpressPlus 
Silicon, expands the PTX3000’s application scope, making it 
the industry’s leading space-constrained core router for LSR, 
internet backbone, peering, and optical transport integration. 
The PTX3000 FPC architecture matches a single FPC slot with 
a single PIC slot for a 1:1 mapping schema. The PTX3000 and 
PTX5000 also share PIC types for interchangeable sparing.

Routing Engine/Control Board Complex

The Control Board (CB), which runs Juniper Networks Junos 
operating system, works with the RE to provide control plane 
and chassis management functionality while maintaining RoHS 
compliance. Software processes running on the RE manage the 
routing tables, while the protocols running on the switch control 
all of the interfaces, manage chassis functions, and provide the 
interface for system management and user access. The system 
can house two RE/CB complexes, with one acting as the primary 

SIB

Both the PTX5000 and PTX3000 switch fabric are engineered 
with a 9-slot all-active SIB architecture. In the case of a SIB 
failure, the remaining eight active SIBs maintain enough switch 
fabric capacity to support full line packet performance per slot—
24Tbps of total system capacity for the PTX5000 and 8Tbps of 
total system capacity for the PTX3000.

Chassis Management

The PTX Series routers deliver powerful Junos OS chassis 
management that allows environmental monitoring and field-
replaceable unit (FRU) control. Chassis management delivers 
a faster primary switchover, enhanced power budgeting with a 
modular power management, reduced power consumption for 
partly populated systems, granular control over FRU power-on, 
multi-zone cooling with better fan speed control for reduced 
noise, and CPU leveling during monitoring intervals.

Simplified Management

The PTX Series simplifies the management function based on 
the elegance and simplicity of the Junos operating system.

technology, the PTX3000 is the most compact core 
router, providing 8 Tbps of capacity at half the size of 
the competition.

Space efficiency and ETSI standards are critical 
requirements for colocations, central offices, and 
regional networks, especially in emerging markets and 
transport-focused environments.

Optical integration
