DATASHEET

8-WIRE (4-PAIR) 
G.SHDSL MINI-PHYSICAL 
INTERFACE MODULE
(MINI-PIM)

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® G.SHDSL Mini-PIM provides the physical connection to G.SHDSL 
network media types, receiving incoming packets from the network and transmitting 
outgoing packets to the network. The G.SHDSL Mini-PIM forwards packets for processing 
while performing framing and line speed signaling. The 8-wire RJ-45 port on the PIM can 
be split into 4 RJ11 telephone ports using the supplied adapter. 

The G.SHDSL mini-PIM has interoperability with the following DSLAM vendor products. 
For the complete and latest list, please refer to Juniper Networks technical publications.
