EX4600 offers fixed 10 Gpbs 
and modular 10 Gpbs and 40 
Gbps ports, giving it the flexibility 
to also be implemented in 
data center top-of-rack and 
service provider aggregation 
deployments.  

Product Description 
Featuring up to 72 wire-speed 10GbE small form-factor pluggable and pluggable plus 
transceiver (SFP/SFP+) ports, and up to 12 wire-speed 40GbE quad SFP+ transceiver 
(QSFP+) ports in a compact one rack unit (1 U) platform, the Juniper Networks® EX4600 
Ethernet Switch delivers 1.44 Tbps of Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity to networked devices 
such as secure routers, servers, and other switches. The EX4600 base switch provides 24 
fixed 1GbE SFP/10GbE SFP+ ports1 and 4 fixed 40GbE QSFP+ ports, providing the flexibility 
to support mixed 1GbE, 10GbE and 40GbE environments. A total of four models are available: 
two featuring AC power supplies and front-to-back or back-to-front airflow; and two 
featuring DC power supplies and front-to-back or back-to-front airflow. Each model includes 
dual power supplies.

All versions feature two expansion slots that can accommodate optional expansion 
modules, providing tremendous configuration and deployment flexibility for enterprise 
distribution networks. Two expansion modules are available:

•  8xGBASE/10GBASE SFP/SFP+ fiber expansion module2

•  4x40GbE QSFP+ expansion module3

Architecture and Key Components
Virtual Chassis Technology

The EX4600 supports Juniper Networks’ unique Virtual Chassis technology, which enables 
up to 10 interconnected switches to operate as a single, logical device with a single IP 
address. Virtual Chassis technology enables enterprises to separate physical topology from 
logical groupings of endpoints, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The EX4600 can 
participate in the same Virtual Chassis configuration with the Juniper Networks EX4300 
Ethernet Switch, delivering highly flexible and scalable configuration options for enterprise 
distribution deployments. 

EX4600 switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration can be connected using up to 16 of 
the 10GbE or 40GbE ports in link aggregation groups (LAGs) across 10GbE/40GbE ports, 
providing an aggregate backplane capacity of up to 1.04 Tbps. 

In the data center, EX4600 Virtual Chassis deployments can extend across multiple top-
of-rack or end-of-row switches, providing tremendous configuration flexibility for 10GbE 
server connectivity by only requiring redundant links between Virtual Chassis groups rather 
than each physical switch to ensure high availability. In addition, mixed Virtual Chassis 
configurations featuring EX4300 and EX4600 switches provide an ideal solution for data 
centers with a mix of 1GbE and 10GbE servers, or for environments transitioning from 1GbE 
to 10GbE server connectivity.

1  If GBASE-T transceivers are used, only 12 ports can operate in 1GbE mode as GBASE-T transceivers cannot be installed in 

vertically adjacent ports due to physical constraints. 

2  All eight ports on the 10GbE expansion module can also operate at 1GbE.
3 Any 40GbE QSFP+ port can be split into 10GbE using breakout cables, providing a maximum of 72 wire-speed 10GbE ports.

Data SheetEnterprise Advantages

The EX4600 delivers a highly available, simple, and scalable 
10GbE solution in a compact and power-efficient platform, 
making it a perfect fit for enterprise networks. 

configuration, backplane bandwidth demands can be scaled to 
maintain adequate oversubscription ratios. Using just two 40GbE 
interfaces, Virtual Chassis bandwidth can start at 160 Gbps and 
grow to 960 Gbps, forming a LAG on all 12 40GbE interfaces. 

Simple

Virtual Chassis technology on the EX4600 dramatically 
simplifies the enterprise distribution layer, eliminating the need 
for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Virtual Router Redundancy 
Protocol (VRRP), complex routing, or VLAN configurations. In 
addition, when deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the 
EX4600 reduces the number of devices to manage and can 
even eliminate network switching layers. A single Virtual Chassis 
configuration can span multiple nodes, reducing the need for 
larger, more expensive nodes on superior tiers. Juniper Networks 
Junos® operating system, which is common across the entire EX 
Series Ethernet Switches product family, accelerates the learning 
curve by enabling the entire architecture to be managed with a 
common set of instructions from a single pane of glass.

Scalable

A single EX4600 can support up to 72 10GbE ports (using 10GbE 
breakout cables on 40GbE fixed ports) at line rate, providing a 
highly scalable solution for the most demanding environments. 
In addition, Virtual Chassis technology makes it easy to scale 
the network while reducing management complexity. By adding 
switches to a Virtual Chassis configuration, it is possible to grow 
the number of switch ports without increasing the number of 
devices to manage. As switches are added to a Virtual Chassis 

Highly Available

When EX4600 switches are deployed in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration, Junos OS initiates a process to assign a master 
(active) and backup (hot standby) switch to manage the 
configuration. If the master switch fails, an integrated L2 and L3 
graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) feature automatically 
switches to the backup to maintain continuous and uninterrupted 
system operations. The EX4600 switch also includes a number 
of other high availability features, including redundant power and 
cooling, graceful protocol restart, equal-cost multipath (ECMP), 
LAG links distributed across multiple slots, and quality of service 
(QoS) to prioritize time-sensitive data, nonstop bridging (NSB), 
nonstop active routing (NSR), and unified in-service software 
upgrades (unified ISSU). Unified ISSU is currently supported 
only in standalone configurations; support in Virtual Chassis 
configurations will be enabled in a future release.

Adaptable and Modular

As business grows, the network needs to evolve. With its compact 
1 U form factor and complete switch features, the EX4600 can be 
easily redeployed in different environments and physical layouts. 
EX4600 switch capacity can be expanded without increasing the 
number of managed devices by simply adding more switches to a 
Virtual Chassis configuration.

Enterprise Deployments
The EX4600 offers an economical, power-efficient, and compact 
solution for aggregating 10GbE expansions from access devices 
in building and enterprise deployments. The switch’s dual-speed 
interfaces also support environments transitioning from 1GbE to 
10GbE. The EX4600 can be deployed in the distribution layer with 
multichassis link aggregation (MC-LAG) (see Figure 1) to deliver 
higher resiliency with a distributed control plane, NSB, NSR, and 
unified ISSU. Multichassis LAG enables two EX4600 switches 
to act as separate devices with their own control planes, while

eliminating STP by allowing link aggregation on the connected 
devices. In addition, unified ISSU allows each of the EX4600 
switches to be upgraded individually without service interruption.

If manageability is a concern, the EX4600 can be deployed in a 
Virtual Chassis configuration to create a single management and 
control plane, NSB, NSR, and nonstop software upgrade (NSSU) 
(see Figure 2). If the total number of access switches in a building 
is eight or fewer, the EX4600 can form a mixed Virtual Chassis 
configuration with EX4300 switches in the wiring closet, enabling 
all switches in the building to be managed as a single device (see 
Figure 3).

The EX4600 easily meets enterprise core switch requirements, 
delivering wire-speed performance on every port, full device 
redundancy, support for L3 dynamic routing protocols such as 
RIP and OSPF, L2 and L3 MPLS VPNs, and a comprehensive 
security and QoS feature set.

Data Center Deployments
The EX4600 Ethernet Switch is designed for low-density data 
center applications where high performance, high availability, and 
energy efficiency are key requirements (see Figure 4). Operating 
at wire speed, EX4600 switches deliver up to 1.07 Bpps 
throughput and a data rate of 1.44 Tbps (full duplex) for both L2 
and L3 protocols. EX4600 switches can be interconnected in a 
Virtual Chassis configuration that also includes EX4300 switches, 
creating a single logical device that offers a variety of port and 
density options for mixed server environments.

Flexible deployment options enable the EX4600 to support 
back-to-front and front-to-back cooling, which ensures 
consistency with server designs for hot and cold aisle 
deployments. Front and rear facing configuration options ensure 
closer proximity to server ports, optimizing performance and 
keeping cable lengths short and manageable. 

For small data centers, the EX4600, when deployed in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, is ideally suited as an aggregation/core 
switch, aggregating 10GbE expansions from EX4300 Virtual 
Chassis configurations in the access layer (see Figure 5).

Customers introducing 10GbE into their server racks can use the 
EX4600 to add 10GbE-attached servers, iSCSI, and network-
attached storage (NAS) with minimal impact to their current 
switching infrastructure.

10GbE Data Center Bridging and I/O Convergence 
Deployments

The EX4600 is a full IEEE DCB-based and T11 FC-BB-5-based 
Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch, delivering a 
high-performance solution for converged server edge access 
environments. As an FCoE transit switch, the EX4600 provides 
a pure IEEE DCB converged access layer between FCoE-enabled 
servers and an FCoE-enabled Fibre Channel (FC) storage area 
network (SAN) (see Figure 6). 

The EX4600 also supports FCoE Initialization Protocol (FIP) 
snooping, which provides perimeter protection to ensure that 
the presence of an Ethernet layer does not impact existing SAN 
security policies. The FCoE transit switch functionality, along 
with priority-based flow control (PFC) and Data Center Bridging 
Capability Exchange protocol (DCBX), are included as part of the 
default software; no additional licenses are required. 

Junos Operating System
The EX4600 runs the same Juniper Networks Junos operating 
system that is used by other EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well 
as all Juniper routers and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services 
Gateways. By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper 
delivers a consistent implementation and operation of control 
plane features across all products. To maintain that consistency, 
Junos OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process 
that uses a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version. Customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

also be exported to leading third-party management 
systems such as HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli, and Computer 
Associates Unicenter software, providing a complete, 
consolidated view of network operations.

•  The EX4600 is also supported by Juniper Networks Junos 

Space Network Director, a smart, comprehensive, and 
automated network management tool that enables network 
administrators to visualize, analyze, and control their entire 
enterprise network—data center and campus, physical and 
virtual, wired and wireless—through a single pane of glass.

Junos Space is an open, programmable application platform 
for hosting a comprehensive suite of network operational 
application tools that provide a smart, simple, and open approach 
for automating the deployment and operation of a Juniper 
infrastructure. Junos Space provides multiple management and 
infrastructure applications for managing Juniper resources and 
assets, including inventory management, device and interface

Features and Benefits
EX4600 Ethernet switches include the following key features  
and benefits: 

•  High performance: Each EX4600 supports up to 1.44 Tbps 
of bandwidth or 1.07 Bpps at the minimum Ethernet frame 
size, with 24 line-rate 10GbE fixed ports, 4 40GbE fixed 
ports, and 2 expansion slots that can each support either a 
4x40GbE module or an 8x10GbE module.

•  Unified in-service software upgrade (unified ISSU): With 

its Intel core processor, the EX4600 switch allows Junos 
OS to run within a virtual machine (VM) on Linux. Junos OS 
runs in two separate VMs in active and standby pairs; during 
software upgrade cycles, the switches seamlessly move to 
the newer software version while maintaining intact data 
plane traffic. This true topology-independent ISSU (TISSU), 
an industry-first software upgrade feature for a fixed-
configuration top-of-rack switch, is supported across all L2 
and L3 protocols and doesn’t need the support of any other 
switches to perform an image upgrade.

•  High availability: EX4600 switches offer dual internal 

load-sharing AC power supplies and redundant variable-
speed fans as standard features, protecting the switch from 
a single power supply or fan failure. DC power options are 
also available.

•  Automation: The EX4600 switches support a number 
of features for network automation and plug-and-play 
operations. Features include zero touch provisioning 
(ZTP), operations and event scripts, automatic rollback, 
and Python scripting. The switch also offers support for 
integration with VMware NSX Layer 2 Gateway Services, 
Puppet, and OpenStack. 

•  Energy efficient: Consuming less than five watts per 10GbE 
interface, the EX4600 offers a low power solution for 10GbE 
top-of-rack, end-of-row, and distribution deployments. 
The EX4600 switches also improve cooling efficiency with 
redundant variable-speed fans that automatically adjust 
their speed based on existing conditions to reduce power 
consumption.

•  Small footprint: The EX4600 supports up to 72 wire-speed 

10GbE ports in a single 1 U platform. 

•  Flexible forwarding table: The EX4600’s flexible 

forwarding table allows the hardware table to be carved 
into configurable partitions of L2 media access control 
(MAC), L3 host, and longest prefix match (LPM) tables. 
In a pure Layer 2 environment, the EX4600 supports up 
to 288,000 MAC addresses. In Layer 3 mode, the table 
can support up to 128,000 host entries; in LPM mode, it 
can support up to 128,000 prefixes. Junos OS provides 
configurable options through a CLI so that each EX4600 
can be optimized for different deployment scenarios. 

• 

• 

Intelligent buffer management: EX4600 switches have a 
total of 12 MB shared buffers. While 25 percent of the total 
buffer space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports 
and is user configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism 
in the EX4600 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while 
providing deterministic performance, significantly increasing 
performance over static allocation.

Insight technology for analytics: The EX4600 provides 
dynamic buffer utilization monitoring and reporting with 
an interval of 10 milliseconds to provide microburst and 
latency insight. It calculates both queue depth and latency, 
and logs messages when configured thresholds are crossed. 
Interface traffic statistics can be monitored at two-second 
granularity. The data can be viewed via CLI, system log, or 
streamed to external servers for more analysis. Supported 
reporting formats include Java Script Object Notification 
(JSON), comma-separated values (CSV), and tab-
separated values (TSV). These files can be consumed 
by orchestration systems, SDN controllers, or network 
management applications (such as Juniper Networks Junos 
Space Network Director) to make better network design 
decisions and identify network hotspots.

Data SheetEX4600 Ethernet Switch•  MPLS: EX4600 switches support a broad set of MPLS 
features, including L2VPN, L3VPN, IPv6 provider edge 
router (6PE), RSVP traffic engineering, and LDP to allow 
standards-based network segmentation and virtualization. 
The EX4600 can be deployed as a low-latency MPLS label-
switching router (LSR) or MPLS provider edge (PE) router in 
smaller scale environments. The EX4600 is the industry’s 
only compact, low-latency, high-density, low-power switch 
to offer an MPLS feature set.

•  MACsec: The EX4600 is capable of MACsec features on 

all 10GbE ports to support 400 Gbps of near line-rate 
hardware-based traffic encryption on all fiber ports, including 
the base unit and optional 10GbE expansion modules. 
MACsec in software will be enabled in a future release.
