BTI7000 Packet Optical
Transport Systems

Product Overview

The BTI7000 line of packet optical 
transport systems offers massively 
scalable, carrier-grade networking 
for simple deployment across 
mobile backhaul, Ethernet business 
services, and broadband residential 
applications. Offering tremendous 
densities and capacities in 
compact, modular platforms, the 
BTI7000 conserves precious rack 
space while facilitating service-
oriented connectivity across metro 
service networks. The BTI7000 
platforms support an entire 
portfolio of client service modules 
and photonic layer building blocks.

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® BTI7000 line of packet optical transport systems effectively addresses 
high-capacity network and service requirements. Purpose-built to consolidate packet 
optical service delivery, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), reconfigurable optical 
add-drop multiplexing (ROADM), and photonic layer building blocks, the BTI7000 
platforms integrate seamlessly with the BTI7800 and BTI800 product lines, and Juniper 
Networks proNX software to address campus, metro, and regional long haul applications.

The BTI7000 line is composed of three platforms: the BTI7200, BTI7060, and BTI7020 
Packet Optical Transport Systems.

•  End-to-End Packet Optical Networking: BTI7000 devices offer a common platform 
across multiple form factors to deliver end-to-end network solutions—from customer 
premises to metro core—that converge Carrier Ethernet, multiprotocol optical client 
interfaces, coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM) and dense wavelength-
division multiplexing (DWDM), ROADM, and photonic layer modules, all in one platform.

•  Flexible Shelf Architectures: BTI7000 platforms offer modular utility for service 

connectivity and infrastructure applications. The any-slot-any-module architecture 
enables provisioning and deployment of any mix of packet or optical layer modules to 
address diverse networking requirements and applications in a configuration that best 
fits your operational model.

•  Expansion Shelf Architectures for Seamless Scalability: The BTI7200 and 

BTI7060 support an industry-leading expansion shelf architecture which enables a 
flexible pay-as-you-grow deployment model that allows capital expenditures to be 
granularly attuned to service growth. The expansion architecture allows deployment 
of additional BTI7200 or BTI7060 shelves, providing incremental service slots that 
are viewed and managed as a single network entity through the main shelf, greatly 
simplifying operations.

•  Common Management and Control: The BTI7000 platforms all use the same 

software, system control processor, and cooling units. Additionally, the proNX 
software manages the entire Juniper Networks BTI Series Packet Optical Transport 
Systems and Ethernet Access Device portfolio, delivering a consistent operational 
model, common software releases, and minimized sparing costs.

Common Equipment

•  The BTI7000 line of packet optical transport systems 
provides carrier-grade, high availability power, cooling, 
and client service module and network management 
communications.

•  The System Control Processor controls platform operation, 

providing external communications for craft access and 
small form-factor pluggable optics for optical supervisory 
channel and expansion shelf architecture communications.

•  A main shelf interface (MSI) provides alarm and shelf 
status indicators, an IP addressable Ethernet interface 
to LAN management, and a 26-pin connector for 
housekeeping alarms.

•  The common communication module (CCM) communicates 

with the client service and reach extension modules, acting 
as the primary interface of expansion shelves back to the 
main shelf within an expansion shelf architecture.

•  The BTI7000 cooling unit consists of two independent, hot-

swappable, multispeed fans which can support extended 
temperatures.

•  BTI7000 platforms provide integrated, redundant, front- or 
rear-mounted -48 V DC feeds. Typical power consumption 
is 25 W per 10 Gbps for a fully loaded system.
