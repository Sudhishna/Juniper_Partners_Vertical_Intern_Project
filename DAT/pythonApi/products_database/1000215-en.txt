Each EX4200 switch includes an integrated application-specific 
integrated circuit (ASIC)-based Packet Forwarding Engine, the  
EX-PFE, while an integrated Routing Engine (RE) delivers all 
control plane functionality. Based on field-proven Juniper 
Networks technology, the Route Engine brings the same level 
of carrier-class performance and reliability to the EX4200 line 
of Ethernet switches that Juniper Networks routers bring to the 
world’s largest service provider networks.

The EX4200 also leverages the same modular Juniper Networks 
Junos OS as Juniper Networks router products, ensuring a 
consistent implementation and operation of each control plane 
feature across an entire Juniper Networks infrastructure.

Architecture and Key Components
The EX4200 switches are single rack-unit devices that deliver 
a compact solution for crowded wiring closets and access 
switch locations where space and power are at a premium. 
Each EX4200 supports optional front-panel uplink modules 
offering either four GbE ports or two 10GbE ports for high-speed 
backbone or link-aggregation connections between wiring closets 
and upstream aggregation switches. Uplink modules can be 
installed without powering down the switch, enabling users to 
add high-speed connectivity at any time or migrate from one 
uplink type to the other to deliver the ultimate in flexible, high-
performance interconnectivity. 

The EX4200 also features a front-panel LCD that offers a flexible 
interface for performing device bring-up and configuration 
rollbacks, reporting switch alarm and LED status, or restoring 
the switch to its default settings. The LCD also displays a Virtual 
Chassis member switch’s chassis “slot number” and Route 
Engine status for rapid identification and problem resolution. 

Dual rear-panel Virtual Chassis ports enable EX4200 switches to 
be interconnected over the 128 Gbps virtual backplane. Switches 
deployed in close proximity, such as wiring closets or top-of-rack 
data center applications, can be securely connected using a Virtual 
Chassis cable and cable lock supplied by Juniper Networks.

In addition, a dedicated rear-panel RJ-45 port is available for out-
of-band management, while a rear-panel USB port can be used 
to easily upload Junos OS and configuration files.

Data SheetEX4200 Ethernet SwitchesVirtual Chassis Technology
Up to 10 EX4200 switches can be interconnected using Virtual 
Chassis technology to create a single logical device supporting 
up to 480 10/100/1000BASE-T ports or 240 100/1000BASE-X 
ports, plus an additional 40 GbE or 20 10GbE uplink ports. 
Additionally, EX4200s can be interconnected in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration that also includes EX4500s, creating a single 
logical switch that offers a variety of port and density options for 
mixed server environments.

In a Virtual Chassis configuration, all switches are monitored and 
managed as a single device, enabling enterprises to separate 
physical topology from logical groupings of endpoints and allowing 
more efficient resource utilization. Highly resilient topologies can 
also be created using the GbE or 10GbE uplink ports to extend 
the Virtual Chassis configuration across long distances spanning 
multiple wiring closets, floors or even buildings.

When more than two switches are interconnected in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the remaining switch elements act as line 
cards and are available to assume the backup RE position should 
the designated master fail. Master, backup and line card priority 
status can be assigned by the network operations team to 
dictate the order of ascension; this N+1 RE redundancy, coupled 
with the GRES, nonstop routing (NSR) and nonstop bridging 
(NSB) capabilities of the Junos OS, assures a smooth transfer of 
control plane functions following unexpected failures.

The EX4200 implements the same slot/module/port numbering 
schema as other Juniper Networks chassis-based products 
when numbering Virtual Chassis ports, providing true chassis-
like operations. By utilizing a consistent operating system and 
a single configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis  
configuration are treated as a single device, simplifying overall 
system maintenance and management.

Individually, the EX4200 offers a number of HA features that are 
typically associated with modular chassis-based switches. When 
combined with the field-proven Junos OS and L2/L3 failover 
capabilities, these features provide the EX4200 with true carrier-
class reliability.

Features and Benefits
Chassis-Class Availability

The EX4200 line of Ethernet switches deliver the same HA 
functionality and support many of the same failover capabilities 
as other Juniper chassis-based systems.

Each EX4200 switch is capable of functioning as a Route Engine. 
When two or more EX4200 switches are interconnected, they 
share a single control plane among all Virtual Chassis member 
switches. When two EX4200 switches are interconnected, Junos 
OS automatically initiates an election process to assign a master 
(active) and backup (hot-standby) Route Engine. An integrated 
Layer 2 and Layer 3 Graceful Route Engine Switchover (GRES) 
feature maintains uninterrupted access to applications, services and 
IP communications in the unlikely event of a primary RE failure.

Figure 3: Support for Graceful Route Engine Switchover (GRES) 
ensures a smooth and seamless transfer of control plane func-

tions following a master Route Engine failure.

switches support internal redundant, load-sharing, hot-
swappable and field-replaceable AC and DC power supplies 
to maintain uninterrupted operations. Thanks to their 
compact footprint, the EX4200 requires significantly less 
power than chassis-based switches delivering equivalent 
port densities.

•  Hot-swappable fan tray with multiple blowers: The 

EX4200 includes a hot-swappable, field-replaceable fan 
tray with three blowers, providing sufficient cooling even if 
one of the blowers were to fail.

•  Redundant Trunk Group (RTG): To avoid the complexities 

of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) without sacrificing 
network resiliency, the EX4200 employs redundant trunk 
groups to provide the necessary port redundancy and 
simplify switch configuration.

•  Cross-member link aggregation: Cross-member link 

aggregation allows redundant link aggregation connections 
between devices in a single Virtual Chassis configuration, 
providing an additional level of reliability and availability.

•  Carrier-class hardware: The EX4200 leverages a purpose-

built packet forwarding engine ASIC, the EX-PFE, which 
integrates much of the same intellectual property used in 
Juniper Networks carrier routers. As a result, the EX4200 
delivers the same predictable, scalable functionality found 
in the world’s largest networks.

•  Non-Stop Bridging (NSB) and Non-Stop Routing (NSR): 

NSB and NSR on the EX4200 ensure control plane 
protocols, states and tables are synchronized between 
Master and Standby REs to prevent protocol flaps or 
convergence issues following a Routing Engine failover.

•  Non-Stop Software Upgrade (NSSU):  With NSSU, all 

members of a Virtual Chassis system can be upgraded with 
a single command. Mission-critical traffic can be configured 
as a link aggregate across multiple Virtual Chassis switch 
members, ensuring minimal disruption during the upgrade 
process.

• 

IPv4 and IPv6 routing support:  IPv4 and IPv6 Layer 3 
routing (OSPF and PIM) is available in the base license, 
enabling highly resilient networks.

Carrier-Class Operating System

The EX4200 runs on Junos OS, the same operating system 
software used by Juniper Networks routers to power the world’s 
largest and most complex networks.

By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control-plane 
features across all products. To maintain that consistency, Junos 
OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process that 
utilizes a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing an entire system down.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all products powered by Junos OS to be 
updated simultaneously with the same software release. All 
features are fully regression-tested, making each new release a 
true superset of the previous version; customers can deploy the 
software with complete confidence that all existing capabilities 
will be maintained and operate in the same way.

By providing Class 3 PoE with 15.4 watts on some or all ports to 
power voice over IP (VoIP) telephones, closed-circuit security 
cameras, wireless access points, and other IP-enabled devices, 
the EX4200 delivers a future-proofed solution for converging 
disparate networks onto a single IP infrastructure. Furthermore, 
any PoE port can provide up to 18.6 watts to power wireless 
access points and other PoE powered devices requiring more 
than Class 3, 15.4 watts of PoE. EX4200 PoE+ switches also 
support 802.3at standards-based PoE+ for powering networked 
devices like multiple radio IEEE 802.11n wireless access points, 
and video phones that may require more power than available 
with IEEE 802.3af. 

LLDP-MED-based granular PoE management allows the 
EX4200 to negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on 
powered devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across 
the switch.

To ease deployment, the EX4200 supports the industry-
standard Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media 
Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED), which enable the switches to 
automatically discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their 
power requirements and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) parameters.

In addition, the EX4200 supports rich quality of service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice and video traffic. The 
switches support eight QoS queues on every port, enabling them to 
maintain multi-level, end-to-end traffic prioritizations. The EX4200 
also supports a wide range of policy options, including priority and 
shaped deficit weighted round-robin (SDWRR) queuing.

Converged Networks

Security

The EX4200 line of Ethernet switches provide the highest levels 
of availability for the most demanding converged data, voice 
and video environments, delivering the most reliable platform for 
unifying enterprise communications.

The EX4200 line of Ethernet switches fully integrate with 
the Juniper Networks Unified Access Control (UAC), which 
consolidates all aspects of a user’s identity, device and location, 
enabling administrators to enforce access control and security 
down to the individual port or user levels.

4

Data SheetEX4200 Ethernet SwitchesPolicy orchestration, enabled via Juniper UAC Enhancement 
Protocol (JUEP),  enables the EX4200 to construct dynamic 
ACLs on a port-by-port basis by associating role/resource access 
policies with authorization table entries.  This allows the switch 
to dynamically create thousands of ACLs or role-based access 
policies in a scaled environment. 

Additionally, a captive portal redirection feature redirects 
URLs from the EX4200 to the Infranet Controller (IC) for user 
authentication and authorization, making the IC a “single source 
of truth” for user and device authentication and for enforcing 
role-based security policies. 

Working as an enforcement point within the UAC, the EX4200 
provides both standards-based 802.1X port-level access 
control as well as Layer 2–4 policy enforcement based on user 
identity, location and/or device. A user’s identity, device type, 
machine posture check and location can be used to determine 
whether access should be granted and for how long. If access is 
granted, the switch assigns the user to a specific VLAN based on 
authorization levels. The switch can also apply QoS policies or 
mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring or 
threat detection by intrusion prevention systems.

The EX4200 also provides a full complement of port security 
features including DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
snooping, DAI (dynamic ARP inspection) and MAC limiting (per 
port and per VLAN) to defend against internal and external 
spoofing, man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

MACsec on the EX4200

A MACsec software license enables the EX4200 to provide near 
line-rate hardware-based encryption of user traffic on a dual-
speed 2x10GbE or 4x1GbE SFP+ MACsec uplink module.

Defined by IEEE 802.1AE, MACsec provides secure, encrypted 
communication at the link layer that is capable of identifying and 
preventing threats from denial of service (DoS) and intrusion 
attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle, masquerading, passive 
wiretapping and playback attacks launched from behind the 
firewall.  When MACsec is deployed on switch ports, all traffic 
is encrypted on the wire but traffic inside the switch is not.  This 
allows the switch to apply all network policies such as Quality of 
Service (QoS), deep packet inspection and sFlow to each packet 
without compromising the security of packets on the wire. 

Hop-by-hop encryption enables MACsec to secure 
communications while maintaining network intelligence.  In 
addition, Ethernet-based WAN networks can use MACsec to 
provide link security over long-haul connections.  MACsec is 
transparent to Layer 3 and higher-layer protocols and is not 
limited to IP traffic; it works with any type of traffic carried over 
Ethernet links.

Simplified Management and Operations

When employing Virtual Chassis technology, the EX4200 
dramatically simplifies network management. Up to 10 
interconnected EX4200 switches can be managed as a single 
device. Each Virtual Chassis group utilizes a single Junos OS 
image file and a single configuration file, reducing the overall 
number of units to monitor and manage. When Junos OS is 
upgraded on the master switch in a Virtual Chassis configuration, 
the software is automatically upgraded on all other member 
switches at the same time.

Data SheetEX4200 Ethernet SwitchesThe EX4200 also includes port profiles that allow network 
administrators to automatically configure ports with security, QoS 
and other parameters based on the type of device connected 
to the port. Six preconfigured profiles are available, including 
default, desktop, desktop plus IP phone, wireless access point, 
routed uplink and Layer 2 uplink. Users can select from the existing 
profiles or create their own and apply them through the command 
line interface (CLI), Junos Web interface or management system. 

An EZ touchless provisioning feature allows a DHCP server to 
push configuration details and software images to multiple 
switches at bootup.

Four system management options are available for the EX4200. 
The standard Junos OS CLI management interface offers the 
same granular capabilities and scripting parameters found in 
any device powered by Junos OS. The EX4200 also includes the 
integrated Junos Web management tool, an embedded device 
manager that allows users to configure, monitor, troubleshoot 
and perform system maintenance on individual switches via a 
browser-based graphical interface. 

When managing a group of EX4200 switches, the Juniper 
Networks Network and Security Manager (NSM) provides 
system-level management across all Juniper switches in the 
network, from a single console.

Finally, the EX4200 switch system, performance and fault data 
can be exported to leading third-party management systems 
such as HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli and Computer Associates 
Unicenter software, to provide a complete, consolidated view of 
network operations.
