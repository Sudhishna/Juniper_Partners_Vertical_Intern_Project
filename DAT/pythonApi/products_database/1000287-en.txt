Voice Modules for  
the CTP Series

Product Overview

Enterprise organizations are 
leveraging the cost savings 
associated with IP transport 
for a variety of new packet 
based multi-media services. 
Yet legacy voice and circuit 
based applications are not able 
to take advantage of these 
savings due to their requirements 
for deterministic transport. 
Many enterprise organizations, 
governments, and first responders 
who have applications that run 
over circuit switched networks 
are challenged by the formidable 
expense to forklift upgrade 
their legacy networks to pure 
IP solutions, yet they desire 
the CapEx and OpEx savings 
associated with IP/MPLS network 
transport services.

The Juniper Networks CTP Series 
Voice Modules enable customers 
to reliably transport analog voice 
traffic over an IP/MPLS network, 
reducing CapEx and OpEx by 
utilizing a single IP/MPLS network 
to transport legacy and native IP 
traffic, enabling a smooth migration 
to a next generation network.

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® CTP Series Circuit to Packet Platforms enable customers to connect 
voice applications easily and reliably across the IP network, bringing the advantages of 
converged multiservice IP networking without the complexities and cost of upgrades 
required for VoIP.

Juniper Networks CTP Series Voice Modules provide the advanced technology and features 
required to reliably transport voice applications across next-generation IP networks. The 
voice modules support T1 and E1 TDM voice and 4WE&M, 2WFXS, and 2WFXO analog 
voice interfaces, and the associated compression module can compress voice from either 
the digital TDM or analog voice module interfaces. 

CTP Series platforms have the field-proven flexibility, performance, and reliability required 
for voice applications, and are deployed in government agency, enterprise, and service 
provider networks around the world.

Features and Benefits
Table 2: Primary Circuit to Packet Solutions

Application

SS7 transport

Eliminates point-to-point T1 and E1 links required for 
transporting SS7 traffic and allows convergence over the 
IP/MPLS network. No hardware or software changes are 
required on the voice switch.

Eliminates point-to-point digital and analog voice switch 
trunks and allows voice trunking over the IP/MPLS network. 
No hardware or software changes are required on the voice 
switch.

Eliminates the need for ISDN PRI service or the point-to-
point T1 or E1 lines required for ISDN PRI, and allows the B 
channels and D channel to be transparently transported over 
the IP/MPLS network.

Enables two-wire phone extensions from PBX voice switches 
to be located anywhere in the IP network, and enables 
the PBX to connect to another PBX/central office located 
anywhere across the IP/MPLS network.

voice switch interconnect over the IP/MPLS network.

ISDN Primary Rate 
Interface (PRI)

Application

Application Description

Benefit

Full T1 and E1 transport 
over IP

Transport full T1 and E1 circuits including framing 
across the IP/MPLS network.

This feature enables SS7 transport, PBX interconnect, and 
ISDN PRI transport over the IP/MPLS network.

CTPView management Secure multiuser network management system 

provides network monitoring, circuit provisioning,  
IP performance reporting, and circuit troubleshooting 
tools.

Fractional T1 and E1 
transport over IP

Transport a single fractional T1 or E1 bundle with or 
without framing across the IP/MPLS network.

DS0 grooming and 
bundling over IP

4WE&M analog 
transport over IP

The ability to bundle any number of T1 or E1 DS0 
channels and have any number of bundles for each T1 
or E1 to flexibly provision and groom T1 or E1 traffic over 
the IP/MPLS network.

Support 4WE&M analog trunking interface with type 
I, II, and V signaling options. Convert analog to digital 
and packetize for transport over the IP/MPLS network. 
Interwork with T1 or E1 DS0s.

2WFXS and 2WFXO 
analog transport  
over IP

Support 2WFXS and 2WFXO analog interfaces with 
loop and ground start signaling. Convert analog to 
digital and packetize for transport over the IP/MPLS 
network. Interwork with T1 or E1 DS0s.

Managers quickly deploy circuits and services while 
proactively monitoring the network. IP performance reports 
provide detailed information on IP network jitter, delay, and 
packet loss. Circuit troubleshooting tools include integral 
BERTS and loops to facilitate quick trouble resolution.

This feature enables PBX interconnect from smaller 
remote sites and ISDN PRI transport with fewer B channels 
transported over the IP/MPLS network.

This feature enables very flexible PBX interconnect from 
one to many sites by DS0 channel grooming each T1 or E1 to 
multiple destinations over the IP/MPLS network.

The 4WE&M interface enables the CTP Series to connect 
directly to analog PBX voice switch trunks and transport 
those trunks over the IP/MPLS network. Bundling of multiple 
analog trunks into one packet minimizes IP overhead. 
Interworking between 4WE&M to T1 or E1 DS0s enables 
small analog sites to be aggregated into larger digital T1 or E1 
PBX voice switches.

The 2WFXS and 2WFXO interfaces enable the CTP Series 
to connect directly to two-wire analog PBX voice switch 
interfaces to extend the phone extension over the IP/MPLS 
network. Bundling multiple analog channels into one packet 
minimizes IP overhead. Interworking between 2WFXS and 
2WFXO to T1 or E1 DS0s enables small analog sites to be 
aggregated into larger digital T1 or E1 PBX voice switches.

Voice compression

The voice compression module supports 2.4 K MELP, 
8 K G.729, 16 K G.728, 16 K G.726, 32 K G.726, and 64 
K G.711 voice compression, and A-Law to mu-Law 
conversion. Silence suppression is also an option on 
each analog or T1/E1 DS0.

The voice compression module can compress all analog 
channels or T1/E1 DS0s. Compression is software selectable 
on each analog or DS0 channel. By using compression and 
silence suppression, significant bandwidth savings can be 
realized.

Echo cancellation

The voice compression module supports an option for 
echo cancellation with 32 ms end path delay  
per G.168.

Fax and modem 
detection

The voice compression module supports an option for 
T.38 fax and modem detection.

Port mirroring

Port mirroring copies any transmit or receive on  
any voice interface and allows it to be sent to 10 
different destinations. 

Auto switch

The status of CTP Series circuit ports is monitored, and 
the circuit is automatically switched to an alternate local 
or remote port when a failure is detected.

The voice compression module can be used to provide echo 
cancellation on all analog channels or T1/E1 DS0s. Echo 
cancellation is software selectable. This can eliminate the 
requirement for external echo cancellation devices.

The voice compression module can be used to detect fax 
and modem tones on all analog channels or T1/E1 DS0s. 
The fax is demodulated and transported over the IP/MPLS 
network. The modem is detected, the compression is 
bypassed, and the call is transported at 64 Kbps.

Port mirroring is a software selection available on any CTP 
Series analog channel or T1/E1 DS0. The voice is copied, the 
signaling is not copied. Port mirroring allows for a broadcast to 
multiple locations over the IP/MPLS network. This can greatly 
reduce bandwidth requirements.

Network and circuit reliability are increased when the 
circuits are automatically restored to alternate locations and 
equipment in the event of an equipment, site, or network 
failure.

Packet protector

Redundant packets are created and transmitted to the 
IP network and then processed by the receiving CTP 
Series platform.

Circuit quality and reliability are increased when IP 
connections experience significant packet loss caused by bit 
errors.
