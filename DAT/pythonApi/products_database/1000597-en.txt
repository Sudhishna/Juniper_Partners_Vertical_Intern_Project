MX104 and MX80 3D  
Universal Edge Routers

Product Overview

In the midst of worldwide digital 
transformation, consumers rely on 
networks more than ever. Global 
e-commerce sales are growing 
20 percent annually; more than 
300 hours of video are uploaded 
to YouTube every minute,1 
and analysts expect 26 billion 
Internet of Things devices to be 
generating data by 2020. These 
trends are straining traditional 
service provider and enterprise 
networks—and budgets—to the 
breaking point.

Powered by the Junos operating 
system and the programmable 
Trio chipset, MX Series 3D 
Universal Edge Routers provide 
powerful routing, switching, 
security, and services features 
that help network operators 
transform their networks—and 
their businesses—in a hyper-
connected world. 

Product Description 
The continuous expansion of mobile, video, BYOD, and cloud-based services is disrupting 
traditional networks and negatively impacting the businesses that rely on them. While 
annual double-digit bandwidth growth requires massive resource investments to prevent 
congestion and accommodate unpredictable traffic spikes, capturing return on that 
investment is elusive. Emerging Internet of Things communications promise even greater 
network challenges in the near future.

At the same time, traditional operations environments are increasingly out of touch with 
consumer and business requirements for rapid service delivery and cloud-like network 
experiences. At the same time, issues related to monitoring and managing transitions 
are placing additional stress on already strained budgets and personnel. And nascent 
technologies like Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and SDN introduce an entirely 
new set of operational questions.

Our hyper-connected world demands more agile, automated, and scalable networks. Now 
more than ever, network operators need to transform their networks—and their operations 
environments—to accommodate this reality. 

Utilizing state-of-the-art software and hardware innovations, Juniper Networks® MX 
Series 3D Universal Edge Routers are helping network operators successfully transform 
their networks and services. Powered by the Juniper Networks Junos® operating system 
and the programmable Trio chipset, MX Series routers offer a rich set of IP/MPLS services, 
consistent low latency, and wire-rate forwarding at scale, while providing the reliability 
needed to meet strict service-level agreements (SLAs).

An Agile Family of Edge Routers
Agility was the overarching design principle for the MX Series portfolio, and our MX Series 
3D Universal Edge Routers were built from the ground up to support a “universal set” of 
edge applications. This approach helps Juniper customers rapidly respond to evolving 
business and technical requirements without sacrificing their current investments; it 
also simplifies operations and extends return on investment. This agility starts with the 
programmable Trio chipset, which is unparalleled in the industry, giving the MX Series 
routers the ability to add support for new features and protocols without upgrading 
hardware. Additionally, features like the Juniper Extension Toolkit provide modern 
programming languages for customization.

The MX Series 3D Universal Edge Router portfolio consists of a broad range of physical 
and virtual platforms that share a common architecture and feature set, enabling service 
providers and enterprises to select the right size platform to match their unique business 
goals and scale, density, resiliency, space and power considerations, and value-added 
service requirements.

Data SheetMX960, MX480, MX240, MX104 and MX80 3D Universal Edge RoutersArchitecture and Key Components
The MX960, MX480, and MX240 are modular chassis-based 3D 
routers that share the following components: 

•  Modular Port Concentrators (MPCs) provide routing, MPLS, 

switching, inline services, subscriber management, and 
HQoS among many other features. MPCs may also host 
interfaces directly or via Modular Interface Cards (MICs) that 
allow users to “mix and match” interface types. Powered by 
the programmable Trio chipset, MPCs collect and stream 
telemetry that identifies resource utilization, loss and delay, 
and other metrics.

•  Switch Control Boards (SCBs) feature an integrated 

switch fabric that connects to all slots in the chassis in 
a nonblocking architecture. The SCBs house the Routing 
Engine, control power to MPCs, monitor and control system 
functions such as fan speed and the system front panel, 
and manage clocking, resets, and boots.  

•  The Routing Engine (RE) provides the control plane, runs 
Junos OS, and handles all routing protocol processes as 
well as the software processes that control MPCs, chassis 
components, system management, and user access to the 
router. REs communicate with MPCs via dedicated out-of-
band management channels. 

The MX104 is a mobile, optimized, ETSI 300mm-compliant 
chassis with high redundancy and 160 Gbps of throughput. The 
MX104 offers up to four MIC slots and redundant fixed 10GbE 
interfaces for flexible network connectivity.

The MX5, MX10, MX40, and MX80 are software upgradeable 
through 160 Gbps, enabling cost-effective “pay as you grow” 
scale to meet evolving market requirements. These routers 
have up to four MIC slots and two fixed 10GbE interfaces for 
connecting to the network.

Key Features and Benefits
Unmatched Network Availability 

MX Series routers ensure network and service availability with 
a broad set of multilayered physical, logical, and protocol-level 
resiliency features, including Juniper’s Virtual Chassis technology, 
which supports chassis-level redundancy while enabling users 
to manage two routers as a single element. Additionally, a 
multichassis link aggregation group (MC-LAG) implementation 
supports stateful chassis, card, and port redundancy, as well as 
subscriber and session persistence. 

Application Aware Networking

MX Series routers use deep packet inspection to detect 
applications, and they consult with user-defined policies to 
determine traffic treatment on a per-application basis, enabling 
highly customized and differentiated services at scale. Working 
in conjunction with Juniper Networks Contrail Cloud Platform, 
MX Series routers can also steer into complex service chains 
and stream granular data to analytics engines and back-office 
systems to permit real-time charging and end-user engagement 
at the application and content level.

Junos Continuity and Unified In-Service Software 
Upgrade (Unified ISSU) 

Junos Continuity and Unified ISSU features remove the downtime 
risks associated with implementing new hardware or upgrading 
operating systems. 

•  Junos Continuity eliminates OS upgrades and system 

reboots when adding new hardware to MX Series routers; 
a plug-in package provides the drivers and support files 
needed to bring the hardware online. 

•  Unified ISSU reduces the risks associated with OS upgrades 

by enabling upgrades between two different Junos OS 
releases (major or minor) with no control plane disruption 
and minimal traffic disruption on the forwarding plane. 

Junos Telemetry Interface 

The Junos Telemetry Interface feature streams component-level 
data to monitoring, analytics, performance management, and 
visualization tools as well as to Path Computation Elements 
such as Juniper Networks NorthStar Controller. Analytics derived 
from this streaming telemetry can identify current and trending 
congestion, resource utilization, traffic volume, and buffer 
occupancy, which can be used to identify issues and make 
informed decisions on network design and investments.

Data SheetMX960, MX480, MX240, MX104 and MX80 3D Universal Edge RoutersIntegrated Timing18

MX Series routers support highly scalable and reliable hardware-
based timing that meets the strictest LTE requirements, including 
Synchronous Ethernet for frequency, and the Precision Time 
Protocol (PTP) for frequency and phase synchronization. 
Synchronous Ethernet and PTP can be combined in a “hybrid” 
mode to achieve the highest level of frequency (10 ppb) and 
phase (<1uS) accuracy required for LTE-Advanced, eliminating 
the need for external clocks. 

Junos Fusion Provider Edge

Junos Fusion Provider Edge enables MX Series routers to act as 
aggregation devices for the Juniper Networks EX4300 Ethernet 
Switch and QFX5100 line of data center switching platforms 
acting as satellite devices while appearing to management as 
a single, port-dense device managed by a single IP address. 
Junos Fusion Provider Edge significantly expands the number 
of network interfaces on the MX Series router while keeping 
operations simple. 

Automated Support and Prevention

Juniper’s Automated Support and Prevention consists of an 
ecosystem of tools, applications, and systems targeted towards 
simplifying and streamlining operations, delivering operational 
efficiency, reducing downtime, and increasing your network’s ROI 
running Juniper Networks Junos operating system. Automated 
Support and Prevention brings operational efficiency by 
automating several time-consuming tasks such as incident 
management, inventory management, proactive bug notification, 

and on-demand EOL/EOS/EOE reports. The Junos Space Service 
Now and Service Insight service automation tools are standard 
entitlements of all Juniper Care contracts.

Junos Automation Toolkit and Juniper  
Extension Toolkit 

Included in Junos OS software, the Junos Automation Toolkit 
is a suite of tools supported on all Juniper Networks switches, 
routers, and security devices. These tools, which leverage the 
native XML capabilities of Junos OS, include commit scripts, op 
scripts, event policies and event scripts, and macros that help 
automate operational and configuration tasks. Additionally, the 
Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) provides a modern programable 
tool kit while maintaining a platform independent architecture, 
and includes support for:

•  OpenConfig/YANG

•  gRPC, Thrift, NETCONF

•  JSON/XML

•  API support for all modern programming languages 

•  Rich on-box scripting support using Python

•  REST APIs 

Together, Junos OS automation and programmability features 
simplify complex configurations and reduce the potential 
for configuration errors. They also save time by automating 
operational and configuration tasks, speed troubleshooting, and 
maximize network uptime by warning operators of potential 

problems and automatically responding to system events.
