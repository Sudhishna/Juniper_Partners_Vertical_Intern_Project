QFX3008-I QFAbRIc 
INTERcONNEcT

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks QFabric System 
is composed of three separate 
but integrated components—the 
QFX3500/QFX3600 QFabric Nodes, 
the QFX3600-I/QFX3008-I QFabric 
Interconnect, and the QFX3100 
QFabric Director. These components 
work together to create a single, high-
performance QFabric architecture 
for the next generation cloud-ready 
data center. The QFX3008-I provides 
the high-speed transport that serves 
as the backplane of the QFabric 
System, enabling the data center 
network to operate and be managed 
as a single, logical device that lowers 
capital, management, and operational 
expenses. 

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® QFX3008-I QFabric™ Interconnect acts as the backplane of Juniper 
Networks QFX3000-G QFabric System, connecting all QFabric Node edge devices in a flat, 
any-to-any topology. 

Each QFX3008-I QFabric Interconnect chassis provides full redundancy with dual control 
boards, eight fabric modules, and redundant power supply modules. Featuring a switching 
capacity of 10.24 Tbps, the QFX3008-I Interconnect offers eight I/O slots for hosting 16-
port 40 Gbps modules, providing data plane connectivity for the Nodes. Each QFabric Node 
connects to the Interconnect via two or four 40 Gbps interfaces operating over standard 
OM4 multimode fiber optics. Similar to the fabric inside a chassis-based switch, there are 
no connections between the Interconnect chassis in the data center; the Interconnect only 
provides transport between Node devices. Four fully populated Interconnect systems can 
scale the QFabric architecture to 6,000 customer-facing ports, with an aggregate capacity 
of 40 Tbps. 

The QFX3008-I runs the same Juniper Networks Junos® operating system as other Juniper 
Networks switches, routers, and security devices. All provisioning and management is 
conducted via the Juniper Networks QFX3100 QFabric Director. 

QFabric Architecture
QFabric technology represents the “1” in Juniper’s 3-2-1 architecture, dramatically reducing 
complexity in the data center by delivering any-to-any connectivity while lowering 
capital, management, and operational expenses. Juniper Networks QFabric architecture 
helps organizations realize the full benefit of their investments in server consolidation, 
virtualization, service-oriented architecture (SOA), distributed application architectures, 
and other technologies. The high-performance, non-blocking, and lossless QFabric 
architecture delivers much lower latency than traditional network architectures—crucial 
for the high-speed communications that define the modern data center. Rather than 
fragment network and server capacity like traditional data center networks, QFabric 
technology implements a single, flexible architecture that enables organizations to 
achieve cloud-like efficiencies and create a more agile environment.

Benefits

The QFX3008-I allows for multi-terabit scaling of the QFabric architecture. Each system scales to 
10.24 Tbps; four Interconnect systems in a QFabric architecture allow for a 40 Tbps data center 
fabric, creating an architecture that can accommodate future 40GbE and 100GbE-based data center 
fabrics.

The QFX3008-I supports multilevel redundancy, including power supplies, fabric modules, control 
boards, and I/O modules. All I/O module slots receive a fair share of the total fabric bandwidth, 
ensuring lossless forwarding in the event of a fault. Each QFX3500 Node connects to multiple 
QFX3008-I Interconnect chassis via two or four 40 Gbps interfaces, allowing for network path 
redundancy with load balancing of application traffic.

The QFX3008-I is a highly available system. Each of the components (I/O modules, fabric modules, 
control boards, power supplies) can be removed or inserted into the system in a nondisruptive 
fashion, providing “five 9s” system availability.

•	 Front-to-back cooling: cooling has a major impact on operational expenses. The front-to-back air 
flow of the Interconnect aligns with the best practices of hot aisle/cold aisle designs for improving 
data center infrastructure efficiency. 
 Independent system fans on the Interconnect provide efficient cooling capacity to the entire 
system. Support for hot swapping of fan trays aids system availability.

•	

•	 The Interconnect cable management system supports cabling requirements on both sides of the 
switch, contributing to configuration flexibility and allowing easy insertion and removal of cabling 
for unobstructed provisioning and troubleshooting without disrupting the system.

•	 A front-panel display allows for easy monitoring of alarms as well as system identification for 

inventory management and maintenance.

•	 A system and line card beacon LED provides ease of operations for identifying and troubleshooting 

faulty cards and avoiding accidental turnoff or replacement of the wrong part. The beacon LED 
can be turned on remotely via software.
