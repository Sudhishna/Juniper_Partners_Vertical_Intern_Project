based control options plus best-
of-breed UTM to protect and 
control your business assets.  
Next generation firewalls are 
able to perform full packet 
inspection and can apply 
security policies based on layer 7 
information. This means you can 
create security policies based on 
the application running across 
your network, the user who is 
receiving or sending network 
traffic or the content that is 
traveling across your network 
to protect your environment 
against threats, manage how 

your network bandwidth is allocated, and control who has access 
to what. 

AppSecure 

AppSecure is a suite of application security capabilities for 
Juniper Networks SRX Series services Gateways that identifies 
applications for greater visibility, enforcement, control, and 
protection of the network. 

Intrusion Prevention

The intrusion prevention system (IPS) understands application 
behaviors and weaknesses to prevent application-borne security 
threats that are difficult to detect and stop.

Unified Threat Management (UTM)

SRX Series can include comprehensive content security against 
malware, viruses, phishing attacks, intrusions, spam and other 
threats with unified threat management (UTM). Get a best-
of-breed solution with anti-virus, anti-spam, web filtering and 
content filtering at a great value by easily adding these services 
to your SRX Series Services Gateway. Cloud-based and on-box 
solutions are both available.

User Firewall

Juniper offers a range of user role-based firewall control solutions 
that support dynamic security policies. User role-based firewall 
capabilities are integrated with the SRX Series Services Gateways 
for standard next generation firewall controls.  More extensive, 
scalable, granular access controls for creating dynamic policies 
are available through the integration of SRX with a Juniper 
Unified Access Control solution. 

Adaptive Threat Intelligence

To address the evolving threat landscape that has made it 
imperative to integrate external threat intelligence into the 
firewall for thwarting advanced malware and other threats, some 
SRX Series Services Gateways include threat intelligence via 
integration with Spotlight Secure. The Spotlight Secure threat 
intelligence platform aggregates threat feeds from multiple 
sources to deliver open, consolidated, actionable intelligence to 
SRX Series Services Gateways across the organization for policy 
enforcement. These sources include Juniper threat feeds, third 
party threat feeds and threat detection technologies that the 
customer can deploy. 

Administrators are able to define enforcement policies from all 
feeds via a single, centralized management point, Junos Space 
Security Director.

Secure Routing 

Many organizations use both a router and a firewall/VPN at their 
network edge to fulfill their networking and security needs. For 
many organizations, the SRX Series for the branch can fulfill 
both roles with one solution. Juniper built best-in-class routing, 
switching and firewall capabilities into one product.

SRX Series for the branch checks the traffic to see if it is 
legitimate and permissible, and only forwards it on when it is. 
This reduces the load on the network, allocates bandwidth for all 
other mission-critical applications, and secures the network from 
malicious users. 

The main purpose of a secure router is to provide firewall 
protection and apply policies. The firewall (zone) functionality 
inspects traffic flows and state to ensure that originating and 
returning information in a session is expected and permitted for 
a particular zone. The security policy determines if the session 
can originate in one zone and traverse to another zone. Due to 
the architecture, SRX Series receives packets from a wide variety 
of clients and servers and keeps track of every session, of every 
application, and of every user. This allows the enterprise to make 
sure that only legitimate traffic is on its network and that traffic is 
flowing in the expected direction. 

High Availability
Junos Services Redundancy Protocol (JSRP) is a core feature 
of the SRX Series for the branch. JSRP enables a pair of SRX 
Series systems to be easily integrated into a high availability 
network architecture, with redundant physical connections 
between the systems and the adjacent network switches. With 
link redundancy, Juniper Networks can address many common 
causes of system failures, such as a physical port going bad 
or a cable getting disconnected, to ensure that a connection 
is available without having to fail over the entire system. This 
is consistent with a typical active/standby nature of routing 
resiliency protocols.

Figure 2: High availability

When SRX Series Services Gateways for the branch are 
configured as an active/active HA pair, traffic and configuration 
is mirrored automatically to provide active firewall and VPN 
session maintenance in case of a failure. The branch SRX Series 
synchronizes both configuration and runtime information. As a 
result, during failover, synchronization of the following information 
is shared:  connection/session state and flow information, IPSec 
security associations, Network Address Translation (NAT) traffic, 
address book information, configuration changes, and more. In 
contrast to the typical router active/standby resiliency protocols 
such as Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), all dynamic 
flow and session information is lost and must be reestablished 
in the event of a failover. Some or all network sessions will have 
to restart depending on the convergence time of the links or 
nodes. By maintaining state, not only is the session preserved, 
but security is kept intact. In an unstable network, this active/
active configuration also mitigates link flapping affecting session 
performance. 

Session-Based Forwarding Without the 
Performance Hit

In order to optimize the throughput and latency of the combined 
router and firewall, Junos OS implements session-based 
forwarding, an innovation that combines the session state 
information of a traditional firewall and the next-hop forwarding 
of a classic router into a single operation. With Junos OS, a 
session that is permitted by the forwarding policy is added to 

the forwarding table along with a pointer to the next-hop route. 
Established sessions have a single table lookup to verify that the 
session has been permitted and to find the next hop. This efficient 
algorithm improves throughput and lowers latency for session 
traffic when compared with a classic router that performs multiple 
table lookups to verify session information and then to find a next-
hop route. 

Figure 3 shows the session-based forwarding algorithm. When a 
new session is established, the session-based architecture within 
Junos OS verifies that the session is allowed by the forwarding 
policies. If the session is allowed, Junos OS will look up the next-
hop route in the routing table. It then inserts the session and the 
next-hop route into the session and forwarding table and forwards 
the packet. Subsequent packets for the established session 
require a single table lookup in the session and forwarding table, 
and are forwarded to the egress interface.
