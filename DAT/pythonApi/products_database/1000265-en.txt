*  Performance, capacity and features listed are based on the vSRX running Junos OS 15.1X49-D70 using 5 vCPUs and 8GB memory and are measured under ideal testing conditions. Actual results may vary based on Junos OS releases and by deployments. For vSRX, the 
reference platform for performance was an HP – Proliant DL580: Gen 9 E7-8890 v3, 2.4 Ghz CPUs, Hyper Threading: Disabled and with Intel 82599 NIC ixgbe version: 4.21. VMware tests were based on ESXi6.0; KVM tests were based on Ubuntu-16.04 with DPDK based 
OVS: 2.7.0. All performance numbers are “up to” and will depend on underlying hardware configuration (some server configurations may perform better).

** Firewall throughput (large packets) numbers on the SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800 platforms are with ExpressPath enabled.
