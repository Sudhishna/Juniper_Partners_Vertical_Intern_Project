(TCO) and lowering power, space 
and cooling requirements.

Product Description 
The EX9200 line of programmable, flexible and scalable modular Ethernet core switches 
simplifies the deployment of cloud applications, virtualized servers and rich media 
collaboration tools across campus and data center environments.

As a key element of Juniper’s comprehensive portfolio of resilient campus switching, 
security, routing, and wireless products, the EX9200 Ethernet Switch enables collaboration 
and provides simple and secure access to mission critical applications. In the data center, 
the EX9200 simplifies network architectures and network operations to better align the 
network with today’s dynamic business environments.

The EX9200 is also a key component of Juniper’s MetaFabric architecture, which provides 
a simple, open and smart approach to building data center networks. Additionally, the 
EX9200 supports data center interconnect (DCI), critical to workload mobility and 
application availability, by delivering leading technologies such as MPLS, VPLS, and 
Ethernet VPN (E-VPN). 

For networks evolving to SDN, the EX9200 integrates with VMware NSX SDN controllers 
and can act as a VXLAN Layer 2 and Layer 3 Gateway. The open and standards-based 
EX9200 platform also interoperates with the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) to support 
detailed management capabilities and integrates with Juniper Networks Contrail SDN 
controller to allow users to choose their preferred SDN systems.

The EX9200 is based on Juniper One custom silicon, an ASIC designed by Juniper which 
provides a programmable Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) and allows for native support 
of networking protocols such as virtualization using MPLS over IP and overlay network 
protocols. ASIC micro code changes delivered through updates to Juniper Networks Junos® 
operating system provide investment protection by allowing existing hardware to support 
new or future networking protocols.

The programmability of the EX9200 allows it to support Junos OS-based automation 
along with the Junos SDK, which enables integration with Puppet and other automation 
applications. The EX9200’s network programmability also enables integration with leading 
orchestration applications such as OpenStack.

Data SheetEX9200 Ethernet SwitchArchitecture and Key Components
The EX9200 campus and data center core Ethernet switches 
share a number of architectural elements. The Routing Engines 
employed by these switches run Junos OS, which processes all 
Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols, while the Switch Fabric modules 
manage the chassis and provide switching functionality for data 
traffic coming from line cards.

The EX9200 line cards, which are common across all EX9200 
platforms, include Packet Forwarding Engines (PFEs) that 
process network traffic, as well as a line-card processor that 
provides scalable local control. 

In the data center, the EX9200 architecture is designed for very 
large deployments, with no head-of-line blocking, a single tier 
low latency switch fabric, efficient multicast replication handling, 
and deep buffering to ensure performance at scale. The EX9200 
chassis midplane distributes the control and management 
signals over independent paths to the various system 
components and distributes power throughout the system. 
Data plane signals pass directly from the EX9200 line cards to 
the EX9200 Switch Fabric modules via a unique pass-through 
connector system that provides unparalleled signal quality for 
future generations of fabric ASICs. 

To maintain uninterrupted operation, the EX9200’s fan trays cool 
the line cards, Routing Engine, and Switch Fabric modules with 
redundant, variable speed fans. In addition, the EX9200 power 
supplies convert building power to the internal voltage required 
by the system.

operational costs by allowing network administrators to connect 
up to 128 EX4300, EX3400, or EX3200 access switches with up 
to two EX9200 Ethernet switches to form a high-port density 
device that appears to the larger network as a single switch.  
A Junos Fusion Enterprise deployment has a single point of 
management—the EX9200 switch serving in the aggregation 
device role—that runs Junos OS and is responsible for configuring, 
monitoring, and maintaining all devices in the topology (see 
Figure 1).

Junos Fusion Enterprise is currently supported on the EX9200-
RE, EX9200-40T, EX9200-32XS, and EX9200-6QS.  Additional 
line cards will be supported in a future software release.

EX9200 Switch Fabric

The EX9200 line cards support an extensive set of Layer 2 and 
Layer 3 services that can be deployed in any combination of L2-
L3 applications.

The EX9200 Switch Fabric modules are hot-swappable and 
serve as the central non-blocking matrix through which all 
network data passes. 

Each EX9200 line card is built upon Juniper One custom silicon, 
which supports a wide range of Layer 2 and Layer 3 Ethernet 
functionality including 802.1Q VLAN, link aggregation, Virtual 
Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), L2 to L3 mapping, and port 
monitoring. Additionally, the line cards support filtering, sampling, 
load balancing, rate limiting, class of service (CoS), and other 
key features needed for the deployment of dependable, high-
performance Ethernet infrastructure.

EX9200 Routing Engine

The EX9200 switch’s Routing Engine is based on the same field-
proven hardware architecture used by Juniper Networks routers, 
bringing the same carrier-class performance and reliability to the 
EX9200 that Juniper routers bring to the world’s largest service 
provider networks. The RE’s central CPU performs all system 
control functions and maintains hardware forwarding table and 
routing protocol states for the EX9200.  Dedicated hardware 
on the RE supports chassis management functions such as 
environmental monitoring.  Communication between RE modules 
and individual line cards takes place over a dedicated internal GbE 
out-of-band control interface.

There are two EX9200 Routing Engines:  the EX9200-RE and 
EX9200-RE2. The EX9200-RE supports control and management 
plane functionality with an integrated Routing Engine that features 
a quad-core, 1.73 GHz Intel processor with 16 gigabytes of DRAM 
and dual front pluggable SSDs, each providing 32 GB of storage for 
Junos OS images and logs. 

The EX9200-RE2 features a six-core, 2 GHz Intel processor with 
64 gigabytes of DRAM and dual front-pluggable SSDs, each 
providing 64 GB of storage for Junos OS images and logs.  The 
10GbE Routing Engine-to-switch fabric interface will allow running 
virtualized applications in the future. 

Both Routing Engines feature AUX, console, and Ethernet ports 
on the front panel to support out-of-band system management 
and monitoring, while an external USB port accommodates a 
removable media interface for manually installing Junos OS 
images. Junos Fusion Enterprise will be supported on the EX9200-
RE2 in a future release.

Two EX9200 Switch Fabric modules are available:  the EX9200-
SF and EX9200-SF2.  The EX9200-SF supports up to 240 Gbps 
throughput per slot, while the EX9200-SF2 supports 480 Gbps 
throughput per slot.  See Table 2.

On the EX9204 and EX9208 switches, two Switch Fabric 
modules deployed in a redundant configuration deliver up to 
480 Gbps system throughput per slot. The Switch Fabric module 
installed first functions as the master, while the second serves as 
a backup.

On the EX9214, three Switch Fabric modules deployed in a 
redundant configuration deliver 480 Gbps system throughput per 
slot. Traffic is load-balanced across the first two Switch Fabric 
modules installed, which together function as the master switch 
fabric, while the third serves as a backup.

Switch Fabric modules perform the following key functions:

•  Monitoring and controlling system functions

• 

Interconnecting all line cards

•  Clocking and system resets

•  Acting as Routing Engine carrier

Power

Each EX9200 chassis contains four power supply bays to provide 
complete flexibility for provisioning and redundancy. The power 
supplies connect to the midplane, which distributes the different 
output voltages produced by the power supplies to the switch 
components, depending on their voltage requirements. Each 
power supply is cooled by its own internal cooling system. All 
EX9200 chassis support both AC and DC power supplies; however, 
AC and DC supplies cannot be mixed in the same chassis.

•  The AC supplies on the EX9204 chassis accept 100 to 240 
V AC input and deliver 2,050 watts of power to the chassis, 
while the DC power supplies accept -40 to -72 V DC input

Features and Benefits
Simplified Network Architectures

The EX9200 is ideal for simplifying campus, data center, and 
combined campus and data center network environments by 
collapsing network layers.

In the campus, the EX9200 collapses the core and distribution 
layers; when used with Juniper access layer switches deployed in 
an MC-LAG configuration, the EX9200 helps eliminate Spanning 
Tree Protocol, dramatically simplifying the network architecture 
and network operations.

Similarly, in the data center the EX9200 can be used to collapse 
core and aggregation layers; again, when used with Juniper 
access switches in an MC-LAG configuration, the EX9200 helps 
reduce the number of managed devices by more than 50% and 
eliminates Spanning Tree Protocol from the network. 

In combined campus and data center environments, the EX9200 
consolidates network layers to simplify the network architecture 
and operations.

In all scenarios, the EX9200 delivers a simple, secure, virtualized 
network environment that increases enterprise business agility. 

High Availability

EX9200 core switches deliver a number of high availability 
features that ensure uninterrupted, carrier-class performance. 
Each EX9200 chassis includes an extra slot to accommodate a 
redundant Routing Engine module which serves as a backup in 
hot-standby mode, ready to take over in the event of a master 
Routing Engine failure. If the master fails, the integrated L2 and 
L3 graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) feature of Junos 
OS, working in conjunction with the nonstop active routing 
(NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB) features, ensures a seamless 
transfer of control to the backup, maintaining uninterrupted 
access to applications, services, and IP communications.

Carrier-Class Operating System

The EX9200 line of switches runs the same Junos OS used by all 
other Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well as 
the Juniper Networks routers that power the world’s largest and 
most complex networks.

6

Data SheetEX9200 Ethernet SwitchBy using a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. To maintain that consistency, Junos 
OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process that 
uses a single source code, follows a single release train, and 
employs a highly available modular architecture that prevents 
isolated failures from bringing down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version; customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

Simplified Management and Operations

A range of system management options are available for the 
EX9200 line of switches as well. 

The standard Junos OS CLI provides the same granular 
management capabilities and scripting parameters found in 
all Junos OS-powered devices. In addition, integrated Junos 
XML management protocol tools provide early detection and 
automatic resolution of potential problems related to the 
operating system. 

Juniper Networks Junos Space software provides system-level 
management across all EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well as 
other Juniper products deployed throughout the network—all 
from a single console.

MACsec

The EX9200-40F-M and EX9200-20F-MIC line cards support 
IEEE 802.1ae MACsec with AES-128 bit encryption, providing 
support for link-layer data confidentiality, data integrity, and 
data origin authentication. The EX9200-40XS line card currently 
supports AES-128 bit encryption; AES-256 bit encryption will 
be enabled in software in a future release. A single EX9200-SFL 
license is required for the EX9200 chassis in order to enable 
MACsec in software.

Defined by IEEE 802.1AE, MACsec provides secure, encrypted 
communication at the Link Layer that is capable of identifying 
and preventing threats from denial of service (DoS) and other 
intrusion attacks, as well as man-in-the-middle, masquerading, 
passive wiretapping, and playback attacks launched from 
behind the firewall. When MACsec is deployed on switch ports, 
all traffic is encrypted on the wire, but traffic inside the switch is 
not. This allows the switch to apply all network policies such as 
QoS, deep packet inspection and sFlow to each packet without 
compromising the security of packets on the wire. 

Hop-by-hop encryption enables MACsec to secure 
communications while maintaining network intelligence. In 
addition, Ethernet-based WAN networks can use MACsec to 
provide link security over longhaul connections. MACsec is 
transparent to Layer 3 and higher-layer protocols and is not 
limited to IP traffic; it works with any type of wired or wireless 
traffic carried over Ethernet links.

Scale Licenses

EX9204-ML, EX9208-ML, and EX9214-ML Mega Scale license 
SKUs enable an EX9200 chassis to support 512K FIB and ARP 
entries. Only one ML license is required per chassis.
