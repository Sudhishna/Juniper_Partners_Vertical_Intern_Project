Product Description 
Core networks must scale in multiple dimensions—on the forwarding, control, and 
service planes. A true multiservice core requires a reliable, high-performance, and 
flexible architecture that can carry a wide breadth of services over a common IP/MPLS 
infrastructure. This enables service providers to deliver stringent service-level agreements 
(SLAs) while minimizing both capital and operational expenditures. Juniper Networks® 
T Series Core Routers include the features, functionality, scale, flexibility and availability 
requirements for a multiservice core. The T Series Core Routers support the features, 
functionality, scale, flexibility and availability requirements for a multiservice core. The T 
Series Core Routers include the T640 Core Router, T1600 Core Router, and the T4000 
Core Router. The T Series multichassis solution includes the Juniper Networks TX Matrix 
and TX Matrix Plus chassis to interconnect the core routers for increased scale and system 
capacity. T Series Core Routers deliver the features, functionality, and scale needed by 
high-end and core networks to meet current and future needs.

T640 Routing Platform  

 T4000 Routing Platform 

At 19 inches wide and a half rack in height, Juniper Networks 
T640 Core Routers address the need for highly scalable, high-
performance core routing at a fraction of the size of competitive 
offerings. Each of the eight slots in the T640 delivers 40 Gbps 
with the ability to scale well beyond that capacity, fulfilling the 
need for the high bandwidth services of today and tomorrow. 

The T640 supports up to 8 OC-768c/STM-256 ports, 40 10 Gbps 
ports (10GbE or OC-192/STM-64), 128 OC-48c/STM-16 ports, 
and an industry-leading 320 1GbE ports. It delivers up to 640 
Gbps of capacity with the ability to forward up to 770 million 
packets per second (Mpps). The T640 also supports lower speed 
interfaces, providing added flexibility to combine high-speed core 
routing with dedicated access aggregation in a single platform.

T1600 Routing Platform 

Also at 19 inches wide and a half rack in height, the multichassis 
capable Juniper Networks T1600 Core Routers address the need 
for highly scalable, high-performance core routing at a fraction 
of the size of competitive offerings. The T1600 delivers up to 1.6 
Tbps of capacity (100 Gbps/slot) with the ability to forward up to 
1.92 billion pps. 

Juniper provides unique capabilities for upgrading T Series routers 
to accommodate the changing requirements of service providers. 
For example, the T640 can grow in-service into a T1600 by only 
replacing the power module and switch fabric. Following such an 
upgrade, the T1600 provides more than double the capacity of 
T640, while only using fractionally more power.

The packet forwarding and switching complex of a T1600 
supports 100 Gbps per slot. Current interface configurations 
include up to 8 100GbE ports, 16 OC-768c/STM-256 ports, 
64 OC-192/STM-64 ports, or 80/160 10GbE (line rate/
oversubscribed). The T1600 also supports lower speed 
interfaces, providing added flexibility to combine high-speed core 
routing with dedicated access aggregation in a single platform. 

Juniper Networks T4000 Core Routers are the highest capacity 
half rack routers in the T Series family, extending Juniper’s 
proven history of innovation and investment protection. The 
T4000 system more than doubles the per-slot capacity of 
existing T1600 systems from 100 to 260 Gbps—and with only 
25% increase in power. Existing T640 and T1600 systems can 
be upgraded in-service to a T4000 system, offering ultimate 
investment protection for a T Series installed base. 

A fully loaded T4000 system can support up to 208 ports of 
10GbE, or 16 ports of 100GbE interfaces, making it the densest 
line-rate IP/MPLS routing system. With a pay-as-you-grow 
model, service providers can migrate in-service and scale a single 
T4000 from 4 Tbps chassis to a multichassis configuration with 
the TX Matrix Plus to support up to 16 Tbps1. The T4000 is a true 
multiservice core system that is designed to deliver a reliable, 
high-performance, and flexible architecture to carry a wide 
breadth of services over a common IP/MPLS infrastructure. 

T Series routers enable service providers to deliver stringent 
QoS and meet SLAs for multiservice transit and IP services. 
In addition, Juniper’s industry-leading IP/MPLS capabilities 
guarantee that the service level and performance of critical 
services are maintained, while extending the effective life span 
of legacy network assets. The T Series is ideal for creating 
routed infrastructures that must scale to meet constantly 
growing Internet traffic for all kinds of applications. Furthermore, 
capacity-based power consumption for all T Series routers is the 
lowest in the industry.

Data SheetT Series Core RoutersT Series Multichassis System 

Juniper Networks TX Matrix Plus is the central switching and 
routing element that interconnects multiple line-card chassis 
(LCC) to build a multichassis T Series system. With enhanced 
Switch Interface Boards (SIBs), the TX Matrix Plus can 
interconnect 4 T4000s or 8 T1600s or a hybrid configuration of 
T4000 and T1600 LCC (see Figure 2).  Table 2 lists the different 
combinations of TX Matrix Plus systems. 

TX Matrix Plus systems deployed with the SIB-TXP-F13/SIB-
TXP-F2s can be upgraded in-service to the enhanced SIBs (SIB-
TXP-3D-F13 and SIB-TXP-3D-F2S) to build the higher capacity 
multichassis systems2. This upgrade enables customers to more 
than double the system scale depending on the mix of T1600 
and T4000 LCCs in the multichassis. See Figure 2 for all of the 
different multichassis TX Matrix Plus configurations. The result is 
increased system capacity and scale with carrier-class reliability 
that delivers non-blocking bandwidth and port density expansion 
options to address the growing bandwidth and service needs.

The scalable configurations with T Series multichassis offerings 
increase equipment lifespan and further reduce CapEx costs. 
Designed with no single point of failure, and utilizing the same 
system design and robust Juniper Networks Junos operating 
system as other Juniper routing platforms, these central switching 
stage platforms are designed from the ground up to achieve the 
highest levels of system availability.

Backed by the industry’s widest breadth of software services,  
T Series Core Routers are designed on a foundation of IP/
MPLS optimized hardware that offers unique packet handling 
functionality unmatched for its flexibility and scale. The result 
is robust QoS for rich and scalable voice transport, video 
distribution, multicast replication, traffic engineering, ATM-to-
MPLS migration, and IP transit and peering services. 

Features and Benefits
The core network is at the heart of any next-generation network 
or multiplay deployment. With the growth of distributed content 
in metro networks, the core network must deliver high-speed 
transport at five 9s reliability, while providing rich service delivery 
features. The T Series family with TX Matrix Plus offers the 
premier core routing option in the industry—ultra high capacity 
core with nonstop operations. Junos OS functionality offers the 
highest resiliency, high performance, and flexible applications 
for backbone networks carrying content intensive consumer and 
business traffic. 

The T Series architecture allows all Junos OS features and 
services to operate across many interface types without 
compromising performance. All platforms are highly secure with 
large filter lists (hundreds of thousands of firewall filter terms) 
and rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
Consistent hardware-based QoS features such as deep packet 
classification, filtering, and granular queuing are deployable at 
large scale for many interface speeds. 

Junos OS is designed to meet stringent service provider 
requirements for operational simplicity and efficiency. Junos 
OS modular architecture supports maximum network uptime 
with features such as process restart, graceful Routing Engine 
switchover (GRES), and in-service software upgrades. On 
the hardware front, all major components—including Routing 
Engines, Control Boards, Switch Interface Boards (SIBs), and 
Power Entry Modules (PEMs) are redundant. 

Juniper’s core solutions deliver unparalleled investment 
protection with PICs that are portable between Juniper Networks 
M Series Multiservice Edge Routers. These include the M40e, 
M120, and M320 Multiservice Edge Routers, and the T640, 
T1600, and T4000 multichassis systems. PICs cover diverse 
interface types (ranging in speed from DS3 to 100GbE) including 
SONET/SDH, ATM, GbE, dense wavelength-division multiplexing 
(DWDM), and advanced security services. From dense GbE and 
10GbE configurations (including two 12x10 GbE Type-5 PICs in a 
single T4000 slot), to high-speed trunk applications at 40 Gbps, 
and 100 Gbps (two 1x100GbE Type-5 PICs in a single T4000 
slot),  
T Series routers satisfy every core application up to the 16 terabit 
realm. The OC-768c and 100GbE options are ideally suited for 
intra-POP (point of presence) locations. The 4-port OC-192 with 
inverse multiplexing provides 40 Gbps inter-POP links up to a 
distance of 80 Km. 

Leveraging Junos OS, service providers can enjoy operational 
simplicity and feature superiority, while alleviating the need for 
complex and costly mapping of software releases to hardware 
versions. The top service providers worldwide all rely on the 
power of Junos OS, and its unique agility and ability to scale 
services across all interfaces helps speed the rollout of new 
service deployments while simplifying management and 
operations. 

One of the key architectural choices in the T Series family of 
routers is the nondisruptive hardware upgrade. This is seen 
in the simple migration from T640 to T1600 (Figure 3), from 
T640/T1600 to T4000 (Figure 4), and from T1600 to the large, 
virtualized systems consisting of the TX Matrix Plus.

T4000 scales to 4 Tbps and T1600 scales to 1.6 
Tbps in a single chassis. The TX Matrix Plus allows 
incremental expansion up to a 16 Tbps system with 4 
T4000s in one system. The future-proof architecture 
scales comfortably to well beyond this capacity as 
provider needs grow. 

T Series scale and density features allow service 
providers to increase capacity without adding 
additional systems to the network. Multichassis 
architecture offers a single network element for 
ease of manageability. 

There is no single point of failure in T Series routers. 
Component-level redundancy is available for Routing 
Engines, Control Boards, and SIBs, as well as PEMs 
and the internal control plane.

High availability (HA) and continuous operation is 
critical in core routing, where loss of a single routing 
node can remove service for a wide geographical 
area. 

Nonstop active routing (the foundation for 
unified ISSU), as well as Junoscript commit script 
capabilities, mean continuous operation under 
maintenance conditions, and topological changes. 

HA requirements in core networks include the 
elimination of planned downtime. Key benefits 
include higher operational network availability, 
better network stability, easier operations, and less 
operational risk. 

Juniper’s programmable ASICs deliver a 
comprehensive, hardware-based system for packet 
processing. To ensure a non-blocking forwarding 
path, all channels between the ASICs are oversized 
dedicated paths. Firewall filter capabilities are 
scalable to hundreds of thousands of entries, and 
include multiple matches and conditions. 

Highly granular QoS, advanced filter-based 
forwarding, flow-based monitoring, and 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) prevention. 
All competing core routing implementations allow 
for a mere fraction of the total firewall filter terms 
supported on Juniper routers without performance 
degradation. 

Interfaces on the T Series range from DS3 to OC-768 
for SONET/SDH and 1GbE to 100GbE for Ethernet. 
Juniper provides the largest variety of interfaces 
among core routing platforms. This interface variety 
(both optical and copper) is unique in the market. 

Combining the functions of previously disparate 
network elements offers greater network simplicity, 
and retains the service building advantages of 
overlay networks being replaced by the converged 
network.

Virtualization capabilities include hardware logical 
routing with the JCS1200, taking control plane 
scalability to a new level by decoupling the control 
and forwarding planes and hosting them on separate 
platforms. Using logical routers, the applications, 
configurations, protocols, and routing tables assigned 
to a logical router belong to that one logical router. 
Juniper’s state-of-the-art logical routing is the only 
implementation with shared uplink support. 

With these capabilities, providers can manage their 
CapEx by consolidating the network hierarchy onto 
a single highly available router, or by scaling service 
offerings in midsize to large POPs with multichassis 
routers. 

Each release of Junos OS runs consistently across 
all Juniper Networks routing platforms and feature 
sets. Junos OS was conceived and implemented as 
a modular design. Advanced features include P2MP 
MPLS, MPLS VPN, IPv6 provider edge, and many 
more unique features in core routers. 

Each Junos OS process runs in protected memory 
to guard against system crashes and to ensure 
that applications do not interfere with each other. 
Junos OS provides the greatest breadth of features 
and most stable network operating system in the 
industry. 

PIC support includes OTN G.709 at 10 Gbps, 
10GbE tunable DWDM, OC768, 4-port OC192, 
40GbE and 100GbE. Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
is continually enhanced along with Ethernet 
Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) 
functionality. 

Integrating optical transport technology into routers 
provides flexibility in provisioning that leads to the 
rapid rollout of new services, while retaining Layer 3 
intelligence to ensure prompt responses to topology 
changes.
