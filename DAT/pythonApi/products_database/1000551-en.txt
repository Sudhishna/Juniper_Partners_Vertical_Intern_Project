SRX1500 Services Gateway

Next-Generation Firewall for the Distributed Enterprise

Product Overview

The SRX1500 Services Gateway 
is a next-generation firewall 
and security services gateway 
offering outstanding protection, 
performance, scalability, 
availability, and security service 
integration. Designed for port 
density, a high-performance 
security services architecture, 
and seamless integration of 
networking and security in a 
single platform, the SRX1500 is 
best suited for client protection 
in enterprise campus, regional 
headquarters or cloud-based 
security solutions with a focus 
on application visibility and 
control, intrusion prevention, 
and advanced threat protection. 
The SRX1500 is powered by 
Junos OS, the industry-leading 
operating system that keeps 
the world’s largest and most 
mission-critical enterprise 
networks secure.  

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® SRX1500 Services Gateway is a high-performance next-generation 
firewall and security services gateway that protects mission-critical enterprise campuses, 
regional headquarters, and data center networks. The SRX1500 is the only product in its 
class that not only provides best-in-class security and threat mitigation capabilities, but 
also integrates carrier-class routing and feature-rich switching in a single platform. 

The SRX1500 delivers a next-generation security solution that supports the changing 
needs of cloud-enabled enterprise networks. Whether rolling out new services in an 
enterprise campus, connecting to the cloud, complying with industry standards, or 
achieving operational efficiency, the SRX1500 helps organizations realize their business 
objectives while providing scalable, easy to manage, secure connectivity and advanced 
threat mitigation capabilities. The SRX1500 protects key corporate assets as a next-
generation firewall, acts as an enforcement point for cloud-based security solutions, and 
provides application visibility and control to improve the user and application experience.

A combination of new hardware and software architectures on the SRX1500 add 
significant performance improvements to a small 1 U form factor. The key to the SRX1500 
hardware is the security flow accelerator, a programmable high-speed Layer 4 firewall 
chip, and a powerful x86-based security compute engine for advanced security services 
like application visibility, intrusion prevention, and threat mitigation capabilities. The 
SRX1500 software architecture leverages these programmable hardware components and 
virtualization to deliver high-speed firewall performance, application visibility, and intrusion 
prevention while lowering total cost of ownership (TCO).

The SRX1500 is purpose-built to protect 10GbE network environments, consolidating 
multiple security services and networking functions in a highly available appliance. It 
supports up to 9 Gbps of firewall performance, 3 Gbps of intrusion prevention, and 4 Gbps 
of IPsec VPN in enterprise campus, regional headquarters, and data center deployments.

SRX1500 Highlights
The SRX1500 Services Gateway delivers a full complement of next-generation firewall 
capabilities that use advanced application identification and classification to enable 
greater visibility, enforcement, control, and protection over the network. It provides detailed 
analysis on application volume and usage, fine-grained application control policies to allow 
or deny traffic based on dynamic application name or group names, and prioritization of 
traffic based on application information and contexts. 

The SRX1500 recognizes more than 3,500 applications and nested applications in plain-
text or SSL encrypted transactions. The SRX1500 also integrates with Microsoft Active 
Directory and combines user information with application data to provide network-wide 
application and user visibility and control.

Data SheetFor the perimeter, the SRX1500 Services Gateway offers a 
comprehensive suite of application security services, threat 
defenses, and intelligence services to protect networks from 
the latest content-borne threats. Integrated threat intelligence 
via Juniper Networks Spotlight Secure offers adaptive threat 
protection against command and control (C&C)-related botnets 
and policy enforcement based on GeoIP. Integrating the Juniper 
Networks Sky Advanced Threat Protection solution, the SRX1500 
detects and enforces automated protection against known 
malware and zero-day threats with a very high degree of accuracy. 

The SRX1500 enables agile SecOps through automation 
capabilities that support Zero Touch Deployment, Python scripts 
for orchestration, and event scripting for operational management.

The SRX1500 Services Gateway runs Juniper Networks Junos® 
operating system, a proven, carrier-hardened network OS that 
powers the top 100 service provider networks around the world. 
The rigorously tested carrier-class routing features of IPv4/IPv6, 
OSPF, BGP, and multicast have been proven in over 15 years of 
worldwide deployments.
