Product Description
The 16-slot Juniper Networks® EX8216 Ethernet Switch, part of the Juniper Networks 
EX8200 line of Ethernet Switches, offers a high-density, high-performance platform 
for aggregating access switches deployed in data center top-of-rack or end-of-row 
applications, as well as for supporting Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet server 
access in data center end-of-row deployments. The EX8216 delivers approximately 
1.9 billion packets per second (Bpps) of high-density, wire-speed 10-Gigabit Ethernet 
performance for the largest data center networks.  

To maximize network investments, the EX8216 leverages the same EX8200 wire-speed 
line cards and power supplies used by the eight-slot Juniper Networks EX8208 Ethernet 
Switch, ensuring consistent performance across the entire product family. Working with 
the EX8208, as well as Juniper Networks EX2200, EX3200, EX3300, EX4200, EX4500 
and EX6200 lines of Ethernet switches, which all run the same Juniper Networks Junos® 
operating system, the EX8216 helps reduce capital and operational expenses across the 
data center infrastructure.

EX8216 Ethernet Switch
The EX8216 modular switch includes an advanced set of hardware features enabled  
by the Juniper-designed EX-PFE2 ASICs. Working with the carrier-class Junos OS, the  
EX-PFE2 ASICs on each line card deliver the scalability needed to support high-
performance data center networks.

Fully configured, a single EX8216 chassis can support up to 
768 Gigabit Ethernet or 128 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports at wire 
speed for all packet sizes, delivering one of the highest line-
rate 10-Gigabit Ethernet port densities in the industry. With 
the EX8200-40XS, the EX8216 can also support up to 640 
oversubscribed 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports in applications where 
high port densities are essential.

At 21 rack units (RUs) high, two EX8216 switches can fit in a 
standard 42 RU rack, enabling up to 1,536 Gigabit Ethernet or 
1,280 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports in a single rack. In addition, the 
EX8216 is just 26.5 inches deep, enabling it to fit into typical data 
center cabinets and making it ideal for existing infrastructures or 
in locations where space is at a premium.

The EX8216 switch fabric is capable of delivering 320 Gbps (full 
duplex) per slot, enabling scalable wire-rate performance on 
all ports for any packet size. The pass-through midplane design 
supports a future capacity of up to 12.4 Tbps, providing a built-in 
migration path to next-generation deployments.

The base configuration of the EX8216 switch includes two 
side-mounted, hot-swappable fan trays with variable-speed 
fans, one Routing Engine module, and eight dedicated switch 
fabric modules (SFMs). The base EX8216 also ships with two 
3,000 watt power supplies, although six power supply bays 
allow users to provision the chassis to provide the power and 
redundancy required for any type of deployment. Redundant 
EX8216 switch configurations are available with three power 
options and include a second Routing Engine module to provide 
hot standby resiliency. Except for the switch fabric modules, all 
components are accessible from the front, simplifying operations, 
maintenance, and upgrades.

A front-panel chassis level LCD displays Routing Engine status 
as well as chassis component alarm information for rapid 
problem identification and resolution. The LCD also provides a 
flexible, user-friendly interface for performing device initialization 
and configuration rollbacks, reporting system status and alarm 
notifications, or restoring the switch to its default settings.

Deployment Scenarios

The EX8216 modular switch is designed for a variety of data 
center deployments, providing a high-performance, high-density 
core platform that reduces cost and complexity while improving 
overall scalability and offering carrier-class reliability.

Populated entirely with eight-port EX8200-8XS 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet line cards, a single EX8216 Ethernet Switch can 
accommodate up to 128 high-speed, line-rate uplinks from 
access-layer devices such as EX4200 switches deployed in 
Virtual Chassis top-of-rack configurations, delivering a highly 
scalable solution that can support more servers with fewer 
switches. Using the 40-port EX8200-40XS 10-Gigabit Ethernet 
line card, the EX8216 can support a similar number of servers 

using traditional standalone or blade-server switches. A single 
EX8216 chassis can also support up to 768 Gigabit Ethernet ports 
or 640 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports to serve as a highly effective, 
end-of-row server access switch.  

The high Gigabit Ethernet and 10-Gigabit Ethernet port densities 
on the EX8216 enable the consolidation of aggregation and core 
layers, dramatically simplifying data center architectures and 
reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) while lowering power, 
space, and cooling requirements. 

Virtual Chassis Technology

The EX8216 supports Juniper Networks’ unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, which enables up to four interconnected EX8200 
chassis—any combination of EX8208s or EX8216s—to operate 
as a single, logical device with a single IP address.  Deployed 
as a collapsed aggregation or core layer solution, an EX8200 
Virtual Chassis configuration creates a network fabric for 
interconnecting access switches, routers, and service-layer 
devices such as firewalls and load balancers using standards-
based Ethernet LAGs.

In a Virtual Chassis configuration, EX8200 switches can be 
interconnected using either single line-rate 10GbE links or a LAG 
with up to 12 10GbE line-rate links. Since the Virtual Chassis 
intra-connections use small form SFP+ interfaces, Virtual Chassis 
member switches can be separated by distances of up to 40 km 
(up to 70 km using ZR optics*). In a CWDM/DWDM network, the 
distance between member chassis can be extended beyond 70 
km. If the EX8200 Virtual Chassis switch members are located in 
the same or adjacent racks, low cost direct attach cables (DACs) 
can be used as the interconnect mechanism.

Data SheetEX8216 Ethernet Switch Since the network fabric created by an EX8200 Virtual Chassis 
configuration prevents loops, it eliminates the need for protocols 
such as Spanning Tree. The fabric also simplifies the network 
by eliminating the need for Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol 
(VRRP), increasing the scalability of the network design. In 
addition, since the Virtual Chassis Control Protocol (VCCP) 
used to form the EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration does not 
affect the function of the control plane, Junos OS control plane 
protocols such as 802.3ad, OSPF, Internet Group Management 
Protocol (IGMP), Physical Interface Module (PIM), BGP and 
others running on an EX8200 Virtual Chassis system behave in 
exactly the same way as when running on a standalone chassis.

EX8200 Virtual Chassis configurations are highly resilient, with no 
single point of failure, ensuring that no single element—whether a 
chassis, a line card, a Routing Engine, or an interconnection—can 
render the entire fabric inoperable following a failure.  Virtual 
Chassis technology also makes server virtualization at scale 
feasible by providing simple L2 connectivity over a very large pool 
of compute resources located anywhere within a data center.

Virtual Chassis technology can also be used to extend EX8200-
based VLANs between data centers by placing an equal number 
of switches in both data centers, or by interconnecting two 
separate Virtual Chassis configurations using a simple L2 trunk.

XRE200 External Routing Engine
In an EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration, the Routing Engine 
functionality is externalized to a purpose-built, server-class 
appliance, the XRE200, which supports control plane processing 
requirements for large-scale systems and provides an extra layer 
of availability and redundancy.

All control protocols such as OSPF, IGMP, Link Aggregation 
Control Protocol (LACP), 802.3ah and VCCP, as well as all 
management plane functions, run or reside on the XRE200.  
Junos OS high availability (HA) features can be enabled on the 
two XRE200s required in a redundant EX8200 Virtual Chassis 
configuration. In the event of an active XRE200 failure, the 
standby XRE200 takes over and Junos OS HA features ensure 
that the state of the Virtual Chassis, L2/L3 protocols, and 
forwarding information are not lost.  See the XRE200 data sheet 
for more information.

Architecture and Key Components
Juniper Networks EX8200 line of Ethernet switches, including 
the EX8216 and EX8208, share a number of distinct architectural 
elements. The Routing Engines employed by these switches 
run Junos OS, which processes all Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols 
and manages individual chassis components, while the switch 
fabrics provide the central crossbar matrix through which all 
data traffic passes. 

The EX8200 line cards, which are common across all EX8200 
platforms, include ASIC-based packet forwarding engines—the 
EX-PFE2—that process network traffic at wire rates, as well as a 
line-card processor that provides scalable local control. 

The EX8216 architecture was designed for very large data center 
deployments, with no head-of-line blocking, a single-tier low-
latency switch fabric, efficient multicast replication handling, 
and deep buffering to ensure performance at scale. The EX8216 
chassis midplane distributes the control and management 
signals over independent paths to the various system 
components and distributes power throughout the system. 
Data plane signals pass directly from the EX8200 line cards to 
the EX8216 switch fabric modules via a unique pass-through 
connector system that provides unparalleled signal quality for 
future generations of fabric ASICs.  

To maintain uninterrupted operation, the EX8216 switch’s two 
fan trays cool the line cards, Routing Engine, and switch fabric 
modules with redundant, variable speed fans. The EX8200 line’s 
power supplies convert building power to the internal voltage 
required by the system.

All EX8216 components are hot-swappable, and all central 
functions are available in redundant configurations, providing high 
operational availability by allowing continuous system operation 
during maintenance or repairs.   

Routing Engine Module

The EX8216 Routing Engine module supports control and 
management plane functionality with an integrated Routing 
Engine that features a 1.2 GHz PowerPC processor with 2 
gigabytes of DRAM and 4 gigabytes of flash storage. A dedicated 
front-panel RJ-45 Gigabit Ethernet port on the Routing Engine 
module supports out-of-band system management and 
monitoring, while an external USB port allows easy uploading 
and storage of software images, configuration files, and logs. 
Direct console access is available through a dedicated serial port, 
while an auxiliary console interface can support remote modem 
access to the switch.

The EX8216 switch’s Routing Engine is based on the same field-
proven hardware architecture used by Juniper Networks routers, 
bringing the same carrier-class performance and reliability to 
the EX8216 that Juniper’s routers bring to the world’s largest 
service provider networks. The Routing Engine’s central CPU 
performs all system control functions and maintains hardware 
forwarding table and routing protocol states for the EX8216 
switch. Dedicated hardware on the Routing Engine module 
supports chassis management functions such as environmental 
monitoring, while communication between Routing Engine 
modules and individual line cards takes place over a dedicated 
internal Gigabit Ethernet out-of-band control interface.

EX8216 Switch Fabric

The switch fabric for the EX8216, distributed across eight rear-
accessible switch fabric modules, serves as the central non-
blocking matrix through which all network data passes. All eight 
SFMs in the EX8216 are always active, providing ample capacity 
to deliver line-rate Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching on all ports for 
packets of any size. If one switch fabric module were to fail, the 
remaining modules gracefully load-balance the data traffic to 
maintain line-rate performance on all 10-Gigabit ports without 
dropping packets. The SFMs are hot-swappable and field-
replaceable, enabling failed units to be easily replaced without 
service interruption.

The eight active, load-sharing switch fabric modules collectively 
deliver up to 320 Gbps (full duplex) of packet data bandwidth 
per line-card slot. The EX8216 backplane connector system is 
designed to support switch fabric bandwidth of more than 12.4 
Tbps—enabling the capacity of the EX8216 to potentially more 
than double in the future.

Power

The EX8216 chassis contains six power supply bays, providing 
complete flexibility for both provisioning and redundancy. The 
standard EX8200 AC power supply delivers 3,000 watts (W) 
of power at high-line (200 V – 240 V) to the chassis. The 
EX8216 also supports a 2,000 W power supply for high/low-line 
operation at 2,000/1,200 W. A redundant-input 3,000 W DC 
power supply is also available for central office deployments. The 
EX8200 power supplies are more than 90 percent efficient at a 
wide range of loads, minimizing building power requirements and 
reducing overall power consumption. These power supplies are 
interchangeable across the EX8200 line, simplifying maintenance 
and sparing.

Although only two power supplies are required for basic 
EX8216 configuration and power-up, the six power supply bays 
provide the capacity required to power all possible line-card 
configurations, and to support N+1 or N+N power redundancy 
to protect against both component and line input failures. The 
actual number of power supplies required depends on the 
combination of line cards installed and the desired level of 
redundancy (see table). For example, 9,000 W is required to 
support a chassis fully populated with 128 line-rate 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet ports.

Data SheetEX8216 Ethernet Switch Features and Benefits
High Availability

The EX8216 switch delivers a number of high availability features 
to ensure uninterrupted, carrier-class performance, and also 
includes an extra slot to accommodate a redundant Routing 
Engine module. When a second Routing Engine module is 
present, it serves as a backup in hot standby mode, ready to take 
over in the event of a master Routing Engine failure. If the master 
fails, the integrated Layer 2 and Layer 3 graceful Routing Engine 
switchover (GRES) feature of Junos OS, working in combination 
with the NSR and NSB features, ensures the seamless transfer 
of control to the backup, maintaining uninterrupted access to 
applications, services, and IP communications.

Carrier-Class Operating System

The EX8216 runs the same Junos OS used by all other EX Series 
switches, as well as the Juniper Networks routers that power the 
world’s largest and most complex networks.

By using a common operating system, Juniper Networks delivers 
a consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. To maintain that consistency, Junos 
OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process that 
uses a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression-tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version; customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

Simplified Management and Operations

A range of system management options are available for the 
EX8216 Ethernet switches. 

The standard Junos OS CLI provides the same granular 
management capabilities and scripting parameters found 
in all Junos OS-powered devices. The EX8216 switches also 
include the integrated Junos Web management tool, an 
embedded device manager that allows users to configure, 
monitor, troubleshoot, and perform device-level maintenance 
on individual switches via a browser-based graphical interface. 
In addition, integrated Junos XML management protocol tools 
provide early detection and automatic resolution of potential 
problems related to the operating system. 

Juniper Networks Network and Security Manager and Junos 
Space software provide system-level management across all 
Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well as other 
Juniper Networks products deployed throughout the network—all 
from a single console.

Performance data from EX8216 switches can be exported to 
leading third-party management systems such as HP OpenView, 
IBM Tivoli, and Computer Associates Unicenter, where it can 
be combined with management data from other network 
components to provide a complete, consolidated view of 
network operations.

In addition, the EX8200 line supports Juniper Networks Service 
Now solution, a comprehensive set of tools that enable Juniper 
Networks Technical Services to automate the delivery of tailored, 
proactive network intelligence and support services.
