Threat Analytics

JSA Series Secure Analytics’ network security management 
solution takes an innovative approach to managing computer-
based threats in the enterprise. Recognizing that discrete analysis 
of security events is not enough to properly detect threats, the 
JSA Series was developed to provide an integrated approach 
to threat analytics that combines the use of traditionally siloed 
information to more effectively detect and manage today’s 
complex threats. Specific information that is collected includes:

•  Network Events: Events generated from networked 

resources, including switches, routers, servers, and desktops.

•  Security Logs: Includes log data generated from security 

devices like firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection/prevention, 
antivirus, identity management, and vulnerability scanners.

•  Host and Application Logs: Includes log data from 
industry-leading host operating systems (Microsoft 
Windows, UNIX, and Linux) and from critical business 
applications (authentication, database, mail, and Web).

•  Network and Application Flow Logs: Includes flow data 
generated by network devices and provides an ability to 
build a context of network and protocol activity.

•  User and Asset Identity Information: Includes 

information from commonly used directories, including 
Active Directory and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
(LDAP). By incorporating patent pending “offense” 
management technology, this integrated information is 
normalized and correlated by the JSA Series, resulting in 
automated intelligence that quickly detects, notifies, and 
responds to threats missed by other security solutions 
with isolated visibility.

Out-of-the-box correlation rules

Offense management

JSA Series correlation rules allow users to detect 
specific or sequential event flows or offenses. A 
rule consists of tests and functions that perform a 
response when events match.

The offense manager allows you to investigate 
offenses, behaviors, anomalies, targets, and 
attackers on your network. The JSA Series can 
correlate events and network activity with targets 
located across multiple networks in the same 
offense and ultimately the same network incident. 

•  Provides hundreds of out-of-the-box correlation 

rules that provide immediate value. 

•  Users can create their own rules by using the JSA 

Series rule wizard to generate automated alerts 
and enable real-time policy enforcement.

•  This allows users to effectively investigate each 

offense in their network. 

•  Users can navigate the common interface to 
investigate the event details to determine the 
unique events that caused the offense.

QID mappings

JSA Series associates or maps a normalized or raw 
event to a high-level and low-level category. 

•  Allows users to see real-time events mapped to 

appropriate categories

Historical profiling

JSA Series magistrate

•  This enables the mapping of unknown device 

events to known JSA Series events in order to be 
categorized and correlated appropriately.

JSA Series collects and stores entire event data 
for later use, enabling extensive use of historical 
profiling for improved accuracy.

•  Allows users to view historical data at any given 
point as well as views into incident management 
and the tracking of events.

JSA Series magistrate component prioritizes the 
offenses and assigns a magnitude value based on 
several factors that include the number of events, 
severity, relevance, and credibility.

•  Allows users to see prioritized security events 
rather than looking through thousands of log 
events.

•  Enables users to see what events have the most 
impact on their business and respond quickly to 
threats.

Offense manager API

JSA Series provides a set of open APIs to modify 
and configure incident management parameters 
like “create, close, and open.”

•  Allows users to integrate third-party customer 

care applications like Remedy and other 
ticketing solutions.

Flow support

Flow support includes NetFlow, J-Flow, sFlow,  
and IPFIX

•  Enables collection, visibility, and reporting of
