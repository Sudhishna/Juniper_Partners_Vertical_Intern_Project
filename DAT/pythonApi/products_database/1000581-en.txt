Data SheetArchitecture and Key Components
Junos Fusion Enterprise Technology

Junos Fusion Enterprise technology provides automated 
network configuration and simplifies scalability for medium 
to large enterprise networks. Using Juniper Networks EX9200 
programmable switches as aggregation devices and switches as 
satellite nodes, Junos Fusion Enterprise technology can be deployed 
across a building (or multiple buildings) to connect large numbers of 
switches in a fabric that can be managed as a single device.

With Junos Fusion technology, enterprises can reduce network 
complexity and operational costs by collapsing underlying network 
elements into a single logical point of control from Junos OS-
based Juniper routing and switching platforms. It is designed for 
customers who need to cost-effectively deploy numerous switch 
ports throughout their enterprise campus network and manage 
them all from a central device. The EX3400 switches can be easily 
added to a Junos Fusion Enterprise architecture with a simple 
software upgrade, offering full investment protection. 

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices are not 
required to be individually connected to aggregation devices. 
Up to 10 satellite devices can be interconnected via standard 
10GbE/40GbE interfaces to form a “cluster,” which in turn can 
be connected to the aggregation device(s) over a pair of fiber 
uplinks. Satellite devices or clusters can also be dual-homed or 
single- homed to the aggregation devices. 

In Junos Fusion Enterprise deployments, satellite devices forward all 
traffic to the aggregation device, enabling network administrators 
to monitor and manage the entire enterprise campus building from 
a single device. Features such as PoE/PoE+, LLDP-MED, and 802.1x 
are also supported in Junos Fusion Enterprise architectures to help 
meet enterprise campus requirements.

Virtual Chassis Technology

The EX3400 supports Juniper Networks Virtual Chassis technology, 
allowing up to 10 switches to be interconnected over uplink ports 
and managed as a single logical device, delivering a scalable, pay-
as-you-grow solution for expanding network environments. 

When deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, the EX3400 
switches elect a primary and backup switch based on a 

set of criteria or preconfigured policies. The master switch 
automatically creates and updates the switching and optional 
routing tables on all switches in the Virtual Chassis configuration. 
Virtual Chassis technology allows switches to be added or 
removed without service disruption. An EX3400 Virtual Chassis 
configuration operates as a highly resilient unified system, 
providing simplified management using a single IP address, 
single telnet session, single command-line interface (CLI), 
automatic version checking, and automatic configuration. The 
EX3400 switches are also capable of local switching, so that 
packets coming into a port destined for another port on the same 
switch do not have to traverse the Virtual Chassis, increasing the 
forwarding capacity of the switch.

The EX3400 implements the same slot/module/port numbering 
schema as other Juniper Networks chassis-based products 
when numbering Virtual Chassis ports, providing true chassis-like 
operations. By using a consistent operating system and a single 
configuration file, all switches in a Virtual Chassis configuration 
are treated as a single device, simplifying overall system 
maintenance and management.

The two QSFP+ ports on the EX3400 switch can be configured 
as Virtual Chassis ports or as uplinks to aggregation devices.

Simplified Management and Operations

Junos Fusion Enterprise technology dramatically simplifies 
EX3400 management by enabling a large number of the 
switches to be managed from a single interface when deployed 
as satellite devices. With features such as plug-and-play 
deployment and rolling software upgrades, Junos Fusion 
Enterprise eliminates the need to individually manage every 
access switch in the enterprise environment, leading to lower 
operational costs and overall lower TCO.

Virtual Chassis technology simplifies network management for 
smaller deployments. Up to 10 interconnected EX3400 switches 

2

Data SheetEX3400 Ethernet Switchcan be managed as a single device utilizing a single Junos OS 
image and a single configuration file, reducing the overall number 
of units to monitor and manage. When the Junos OS is upgraded 
on the master switch in an EX3400 Virtual Chassis configuration, 
the software is automatically upgraded on all other member 
switches at the same time.

In addition, a feature called system snapshot makes a copy of 
all software files used to run the switch, including the Junos 
operating system, the active configuration, and the rescue 
configuration. These copies can be used to reboot the switch the 
next time it is powered up or as a backup boot option. The Junos 
OS software can also be preinstalled on a flash drive and used to 
boot the EX3400 at any time.

Another feature, called automatic software download, enables 
network administrators to easily upgrade the EX3400 using 
the DHCP message exchange process to download and install 
software packages. Users simply configure the automatic 
software download feature on EX3400 switches acting as DHCP 
clients and establish a path to the server where the software 
package file is installed. The server then communicates the path 
to the software package file through DHCP server messages.

A zero touch provisioning (ZTP) feature allows a DHCP server 
to push configuration details and software images to multiple 
switches at boot-up time.

Three system management options are available for the EX3400 
line. The standard Junos OS CLI management interface offers 
the same granular capabilities and scripting parameters found in 
any router powered by the Junos operating system. The EX3400 
also includes the integrated J-Web interface, an embedded Web-
based device manager that allows users to configure, monitor, 
troubleshoot, and perform system maintenance on individual 
switches via a browser-based graphical interface. 

Juniper Networks Junos Space Network Director software can be 
used to manage the EX3400, both as a standalone device and as 
satellite devices in a Junos Fusion Enterprise deployment.

Finally, EX3400 fault, configuration, and performance data can 
also be exported to leading third-party management systems 
such as HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli, and Computer Associates 
Unicenter software, providing a complete, consolidated view of 
network operations.

Features and Benefits
Power

The EX3400 supports the 802.3af Class 3 Power over Ethernet 
(PoE) and 802.3at PoE+ standards for supporting networked 
devices such as telephones, video cameras, IEEE 802.11ac WLAN 
access points, and videophones in converged networks. While 
EX3400 switches ship with a single power supply by default, 
they can support redundant 600W or 920W power supplies that 
provide PoE (15.4W) or PoE+ (30W) power to all ports in the 
switch. Spare power supplies can be ordered as needed.

There are two PoE power mode settings on the EX3400 switches:

•  Static mode allows customers to specify the maximum PoE 

power setting on an individual port.

•  Class mode allows end devices to specify PoE class and 
negotiate whether the switch can provide PoE power to  
the device.

The EX3400 also supports the industry-standard Link Layer 
Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and LLDP-Media Endpoint Discovery 
(LLDP-MED), which enable the switches to automatically 
discover Ethernet-enabled devices, determine their power 
requirements, and assign virtual LAN (VLAN) parameters. LLDP-
MED-based granular PoE management allows the EX3400 to 
negotiate PoE usage down to a fraction of a watt on powered 
devices, enabling more efficient PoE utilization across the switch.

The EX3400 supports the IEEE 802.3az standard for Energy 
Efficient Ethernet (EEE) functionality, reducing power consumption 
of copper physical layers during periods of low link utilization.

In addition, the EX3400 supports rich quality-of-service (QoS) 
functionality for prioritizing data, voice, and video traffic. The 
switches support 12 QoS queues (8 unicast and 4 multicast) on 
every port, enabling them to maintain multilevel, end-to-end 
traffic prioritization. The EX3400 also supports a wide range of 
scheduling options, such as priority and shaped-deficit weighted 
round-robin (SDWRR) scheduling.

Security

The EX3400 switches fully interoperate with Juniper Networks 
Access Policy Infrastructure, which consolidates all aspects of a 
user’s identity, device, and location, enabling administrators to 
enforce access control and security down to the individual port 
or user levels. Working as an enforcement point in the Access 
Policy Infrastructure, the EX3400 provides both standards-
based 802.1X port-level access control and Layer 2-4 policy

combination of these. A user’s identity, device type, machine 
posture check, and location can be used to not only grant or deny 
access but also to determine the duration of access. If access is 
granted, the switch assigns the user to a specific VLAN based on 
authorization levels. The switch can also apply QoS policies or 
mirror user traffic to a central location for logging, monitoring, or 
threat detection by an intrusion prevention system (IPS).

The EX3400 also provides a full complement of port security 
features, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
snooping, dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), and media access 
control (MAC) limiting to defend against internal and external 
spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

MACsec

EX3400 switches support IEEE 802.1ae MACsec, providing 
support for link-layer data confidentiality, data integrity, and data 
origin authentication. The MACsec feature enables the EX3400 
to support 88 Gbps of near line-rate hardware-based traffic 
encryption on all GbE and 10GbE ports.

Defined by IEEE 802.1AE, MACsec provides secure, encrypted 
communication at the link layer that is capable of identifying 
and preventing threats from DoS and intrusion attacks, as well 
as man-in-the-middle, masquerading, passive wiretapping, 
and playback attacks launched from behind the firewall. When 
MACsec is deployed on switch ports, all traffic is encrypted on the 
wire but traffic inside the switch is not. This allows the switch to 
apply all network policies such as QoS, deep packet inspection, 
and sFlow to each packet without compromising the security of 
packets on the wire.

Hop-by-hop encryption enables MACsec to secure 
communications while maintaining network intelligence. In 
addition, Ethernet-based WAN networks can use MACsec to 
provide link security over long-haul connections. MACsec is 
transparent to Layer 3 and higher-layer protocols and is not 
limited to IP traffic—it works with any type of wired or wireless 
traffic carried over Ethernet links.

Junos Operating System

The EX3400 switches run the same Junos OS that is used by 
other Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, QFX Series 
Switches, Juniper Routers, Juniper SRX Firewalls, and the Juniper 
NFX Series Network Services Platform. By utilizing a common 
operating system, Juniper delivers a consistent implementation 
and operation of control plane features across all products. 
To maintain that consistency, Junos OS adheres to a highly 
disciplined development process that uses a single source 
code and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing an entire system down.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version. Customers can deploy the software with 
complete confidence that all existing capabilities are maintained 
and operate in the same way.

Converged Environments

The EX3400 switches provide a flexible solution for demanding 
converged data, voice, and video environments. The EX3400-
24P and EX3400-48P support PoE+, delivering up to 30 watts of 
power per port to support networked devices such as telephones, 
video cameras, IEEE 802.11ac wireless LAN (WLAN) access 
points, and videophones. The PoE+ standard provides nearly 
double the 15.4 watts per port available with the IEEE 802.3af 
PoE standard.

High Availability

The EX3400 line of Ethernet switches is designed to support 
many of the same failover capabilities and high availability (HA) 
functionality as other Juniper EX access switches with Virtual 
Chassis technology.

Each EX3400 switch is capable of functioning as a Routing Engine 
(RE) when deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration. When two 
or more EX3400 switches are interconnected in a Virtual Chassis 
configuration, all member switches share a single control plane.

integrated Layer 2 and Layer 3 graceful Routing Engine switchover 
(GRES) feature maintains uninterrupted access to applications, 
services, and IP communications in the unlikely event of a master 
Routing Engine failure. 

When more than two switches are interconnected in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration, the remaining switch elements act as line 
cards and are available to take on the backup Routing Engine 
position should the designated master fail. Master, backup, 
and line card priority status can be assigned by the network 
operations team to dictate the order of ascension. This N+1 
Routing Engine redundancy—coupled with GRES, the nonstop 
routing (NSR), and, in the future, the nonstop bridging (NSB) 
capabilities of Junos OS—ensures a smooth transfer of control 
plane functions following unexpected failures.

The EX3400 also supports the following HA features:
