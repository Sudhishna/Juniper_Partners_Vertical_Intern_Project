# Apple ZTPO (Zero Touch Provisioning & Operation)

### Environment Setup:
1.	Spin 2 Virtual Machines (Ubuntu) 
2.	Setup one of the VMs as a DHCP Server
3.	Setup the other one as TFTP Server

### Planned Workflow:
1.	The new devices are cabled. (Device Status is OFF)
2.	In the GUI: User chooses the number of Spines and Leaves
	 and the below topology is generated

3.	In the topology that appears, the user will enter the Serial Number of the Spines and Leaves by clicking on the boxes.

4.	The User can now Boot/ON the devices.
5.	### ZTPO Starts:
	- DHCP Server assigns the IP address
	- TFTP Server pushes CONFIG (netconf and login credentials)
	- Python Script runs as CRON. 
	  - Keeps tracking the dhcp leases file and triggers Action.
	- Action would be:
	  - fetch the Serial Number of the device
	  - match the Serial Number against the Database and fetch the CONFIG and IMG file. 
	  - Upgrade to the new IMG and push CONFIG
6.	The Entire ZTPO Process communicates with the GUI to give live updates. And the GUI will transition as shown below.

#### NOTE: The images represent the GUI that will be built. Once we build the GUI, it will be replaced by the actual snapshots.
