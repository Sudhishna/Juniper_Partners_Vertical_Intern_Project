BTI7801 Packet Optical  
Transport System

Product Overview

Legacy wavelength-division 
multiplexing (WDM) systems 
can’t meet the capacity and price/
performance demands of today’s 
metro networks. Today’s content 
providers, colocation providers, 
and service providers require a 
new generation of extremely 
compact and simple-to-manage 
100/200 Gbps optical platforms 
to interconnect data centers 
and support contemporary 
applications.

The BTI7801 Packet Optical 
Transport System provides large-
scale 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 
200 Gbps wavelength capacities 
with industry-leading density and 
performance.  

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® BTI7801 Packet Optical Transport System is specifically designed 
to meet the unique power, space, and manageability requirements of small, unattended 
sites. Optimized for space-constrained environments, the compact platform supports up to 
twelve 10 Gbps interfaces, four 100 Gbps interfaces, and two 200 Gbps interfaces in a 1 U 
footprint. The BTI7801 is ideal for content provider, colocation provider, or hosting provider 
deployments where space and power are at a premium.

An integral member of the BTI7800 line of packet optical transport systems, the BTI7801 
leverages common service modules, software and management interfaces for unified 
sparing, logistics, and operations. The platform supports redundant AC or DC power 
options and field-replaceable management modules.

Architecture and Key Components
The BTI7801 provides a seamless upgrade path from 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 200 Gbps, 
as well as an easy migration path to future higher bandwidth interfaces. The platform 
supports a wide range of interfaces, including 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps, 200 Gbps, OTU2, OTU4, 
and OC-192/STM-64. 

The SDN-enabled BTI7801 is supported by the comprehensive Juniper Networks proNX 
software product line to streamline network operations. The proNX Control software 
enables easy integration with back-office systems and applications through open RESTful 
APIs. The proNX Service Manager provides point-and-click service provisioning, fault and 
performance monitoring, and troubleshooting for the BTI7801. The proNX Dashboard 
delivers a concise view of the health and performance of all BTI7800 networking platforms, 
enabling more proactive and efficient network management. Ideal for unattended sites, the 
BTI7801 supports management via SNMP, NETCONF, and a CLI.

Features and Benefits

•  Optimized for small sites: The BTI7801’s compact form factor minimizes rack space 

and power requirements.

• 

Ideal for unattended locations: The BTI7801 supports remote provisioning and 
management, greatly simplifying support and making it the ideal solution for 
locations lacking technical support.

•  Easy to deploy: The BTI7801 is simple to install and configure.

•  Cost-effective operations: The BTI7800 chassis-based solutions share a common 

set of service modules, software, and management interfaces.

•  Multipurpose platform: The BTI7801 supports 10GbE and 100GbE options equally.
