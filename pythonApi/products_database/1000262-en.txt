Product Description
The Juniper Networks® EX8200 line of Ethernet switches offer powerful, modular platforms 
that deliver the performance, scalability, and carrier-class reliability required for today’s 
high-density enterprise data center access and core and campus aggregation and core 
environments, as well as high-performance service provider interconnects. 

EX8200 Ethernet line cards are specifically designed to optimize enterprise applications. 
Each EX8200 Ethernet line card includes either two or four on-board Packet Forwarding 
Engines—the EX-PFE2—that are equipped with two purpose-built, application-specific 
integrated circuits (ASICs), one to perform wire-speed packet processing at line rates, and 
another to perform internal deep packet queuing and buffering while providing a high-
speed interface to the chassis switch fabric. In addition, each line card contains a local 
processor which provides scalable local control and status processing. 

Eight versions of the EX8200 Ethernet line cards are available, each of which supports 
a consistent set of features and capabilities: the EX8200-48T, the EX8200-48F, the 
EX8200-8XS, the EX8200-40XS, the EX8200-48TL, the EX8200-48PL, the EX8200-
2XS-40T and the EX8200-2XS-40P. Four of these cards are available in Extra Scale (ES) 
configurations—the EX8200-48T-ES, the EX8200-48F-ES, the EX8200-8XS-ES and 
the EX8200-40XS-ES—which are optimized for large-scale deployments such as large 
campuses, global data centers, or cloud-based applications.

EX8200-48T: The EX8200-48T Ethernet line card offers wire-rate 48 
10/100/1000BASE-T ports with RJ-45 copper connectors. Designed for data center end-
of-row server access, or campus applications where high densities, high performance, and 
high availability over copper links of up to 100 m are required, the EX8200-48T enables up 
to 384 line-rate ports in a single EX8208 chassis, or 768 ports in an EX8216 chassis. 

EX8200-48F: The EX8200-48F is a 48-port wire-rate 100BASE-FX/1000BASE-X line 
card with modular small form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP) interfaces for supporting 
a wide range of 100 Mbps or Gigabit Ethernet optical connections over multimode fiber, 
single-mode fiber, or copper cabling. Designed for high-performance enterprise and service 
provider distribution applications, the EX8200-48F also enables up to 384 line-rate ports 
in an EX8208 chassis, and 768 ports in an EX8216 chassis.

EX8200-8XS: The EX8200-8XS is an eight-port 10GBASE-X line card with compact, 
modular SFP+ fiber optic interfaces, enabling up to 64 line-rate 10-Gigabit Ethernet 
ports in an EX8208 chassis and 128 ports in an EX8216 chassis. The EX8200-8XS is ideal 
for enterprise applications such as campus or data center uplink aggregation, core and 
backbone interconnects, and for service provider deployments requiring high-density, wire-
speed 10-Gigabit Ethernet interconnects in metro area networks, Internet exchange points, 
and points of presence (POPs). The 10-Gigabit Ethernet port densities afforded by the 
EX8200-8XS line cards also enable EX8200 switches to consolidate aggregation and core 
layers in the data center, simplifying the network architecture and reducing power, space, 
and cooling requirements while lowering total cost of ownership (TCO).

Data SheetOversubscribed Server and User Access

The EX8200 includes five oversubscribed line cards that provide 
cost-effective GbE and 10GbE server access for high-density 
data centers.

EX8200-40XS:  The EX8200-40XS is a 40-port oversubscribed 
10GbE solution for data center end-of-row and middle-of-row 
server access, as well as for data center blade switch and top-
of-rack or campus uplink aggregation deployments. Optimized 
for data center networks migrating from GbE to 10GbE interfaces 
where simultaneous line-rate performance is not required on all 
ports, the EX8200-40XS supports a wide range of both SFP (GbE) 
and SFP+ (10GbE) modular optical interfaces for connecting over 
multimode fiber, single mode fiber, and copper cabling.

The 40 SFP/SFP+ ports on the EX8200-40XS are divided 
into eight independent groups of five ports each. Because port 
groups are independent of one another, each group can have its 
own oversubscription ratio, providing customers with maximum 
deployment flexibility. Each group dedicates 10 gigabits per 
second (Gbps) of switching bandwidth to be dynamically 
shared among the ports; queues are allocated within a 1 MB 
oversubscription buffer based on the number of active ports in a 
group and the types of interfaces installed. Users simply connect 
the cables and the EX8200-40XS automatically provisions each 
port group accordingly. No manual configuration is required.

The EX8200-40XS line card can satisfy either 10GbE or GbE 
applications within each port group independently, providing the 
perfect migration vehicle for customers transitioning to higher 
speed connectivity.

EX8200-48TL:  The EX8200-48TL offers 48 oversubscribed 
(2.4:1) 10/100/1000BASE-T RJ-45 ports to provide cost-effective 
GbE server access in high-density data center end-of-row 
applications. The EX8200-48TL also supports server access, 
converged access, and aggregation/core deployments, where it 
can be used to connect management stations, analyzers, sniffers, 
firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention/intrusion detection 
service (IDP/IDS) devices, server load balancers, and other devices. 

The EX8200-48TL, which delivers up to 24 Gbps and 36 million 
packets per second (pps) performance, supports MACSec 
functionality on all GbE ports in hardware  and features eight 
quality-of-service (QoS) queues per port. Configured exclusively 
with EX8200-48TL line cards, a single EX8208 chassis can 
support up to 384 GbE ports while a single EX8216 chassis can 
support up to 768 GbE ports. 

EX8200-48PL:  The EX8200-48PL is physically identical to 
the -48TL and includes support for the IEEE 802.3af Power 
over Ethernet (PoE) standard. It delivers up to 15.4 watts of 
Class 3 PoE on all 48 ports to power networked devices such as 

telephones, video cameras, and wireless LAN (WLAN) access 
points, providing an EX8200-based user access or converged 
access/core solution. In addition, the first 12 ports are capable of 
supporting the IEEE 802.3at PoE+ standard, which delivers up 
to 30 watts per port to power devices that require more than the 
15.4 watts provided by Class 3 PoE.

EX8200-2XS-40T:  The EX8200-2XS-40T is a combination 
card offering 40 oversubscribed (2.5:1) 10/100/1000BASE-T RJ-
45 ports, four line-rate 100/1000BASE-SX SFP ports, and two 
line-rate 10GbE SFP+ ports for uplink connectivity. The EX8200-
2XS-40T is ideal for providing GbE/10GbE uplink capacity by 
combining the fiber ports into a link aggregation group (LAG); 
meanwhile, the remaining slots in the EX8200 chassis can be 
populated with EX8200-48TL line cards to provide access 
connectivity. The two SFP+ 10GbE uplink ports can also be used 
as Virtual Chassis ports when the EX8200 is deployed in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration.

The EX8200-2XS-40T, which delivers up to 24 Gbps performance 
on the GbE ports and up to 20 Gbps performance on the 10GbE 
ports, supports MACSec functionality on all GbE ports in hardware. 
Configured exclusively with EX8200-2XS-40T line cards, a single 
EX8208 chassis can support up to 352 GbE ports and 16 10GbE 
ports, while a single EX8216 chassis can support up to 704 GbE 
ports and 32 10GbE ports. Each port features eight QoS queues 
and 21 MB (GbE) and 512 MB (10GbE) buffers.

EX8200-2XS-40P:  The EX8200-2XS-40P is physically identical 
to the -40T and includes support for the IEEE 802.3af PoE 
standard, which delivers up to 15.4 watts of Class 3 PoE on all 
40 ports to power networked devices such as telephones, video 
cameras, and wireless LAN (WLAN) access points. The first 12 
ports are also capable of supporting the IEEE 802.3at PoE+ 
standard, which delivers up to 30 watts per port to power devices 
that require more than the 15.4 watts provided by Class 3 PoE.

Extra Scale Line Cards
The EX8200-48T-ES, EX8200-48F-ES, EX8200-8XS-ES and 
EX8200-40XS-ES extra-scale line cards are optimized for large-
scale deployments such as large campuses, global data centers, 
cloud-based applications, and internet peering environments.  
The ES cards provide twice the Forwarding Information Base 
(FIB) table capacity of the non ES cards, enabling them to 
support multiple copies of complete internet routing tables.  
Designed for internet-facing environments, the ES cards are 
otherwise identical to the non-ES versions and are available in 
both copper (EX8200-48T-ES) and fiber (EX8200-8XS-ES, 
EX8200-48F-ES and EX8200-40XS-ES) versions.

Data SheetEX8200 Ethernet Line CardsFeatures and Benefits
The EX8200 PFE2 complex is comprised of two ASICs: the 
packet processor and the switch fabric interface. The hardware 
pipeline on the packet processor ASIC supports approximately 
960 Mpps of Layer 2 and Layer 3 IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in the 
EX8208, and more than 1900 Mpps in the EX8216. Wire-speed 
performance is maintained regardless of packet size, from 64- 
to 9216-byte jumbo frames across both L2 and L3 interfaces. 
Firewall (access control list) filtering, marking, and rate limiting 
also occur at wire rate, with up to 64,000 entries across L2-L4 
packet headers that can be applied per port, per VLAN, and per 
routed interface. 

The packet processor ASIC also supports generic routing 
encapsulation (GRE) tunneling and three-label MPLS in 
hardware at line rate .  Additional packet processor ASIC 
capabilities include multiple queues for CPU-bound control 
traffic to protect the Routing Engine from denial of service (DoS) 
attacks, and support for up to seven mirrored analyzer sessions 
directed to individual ports, VLANs, or tunneled interfaces.

The switch fabric interface ASIC of the EX-PFE2 manages 
the large ingress and egress buffers that provide congestion 
avoidance and traffic prioritization. On ingress, each switch fabric 
interface queues packets based on destination using dedicated 
high- and low-priority buffers for each wire-speed, 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet egress port, or each group of 12 Gigabit Ethernet ports 
in the system. These weighted random early detection (WRED) 
virtual output queues—up to 8,192 in an EX8216 chassis—prevent 
“head-of-line blocking” among ports on the same line card, 
ensuring complete independence of traffic flows among all 
10-Gigabit Ethernet ports in the system.

The switch fabric interface also manages the transfer of data 
across the distributed, single-tier crossbar switch fabric. Data 
is evenly distributed across the fabric to balance traffic load 
and ensure graceful degradation of performance in the event 
of a non-redundant switch fabric failure. Multicast traffic is also 
balanced across the system using the same line-rate, binary-tree 
replication process as the Juniper Networks T Series Core Routers 
and the Juniper Networks MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers, 
minimizing fabric congestion while reducing latency.

On egress, the switch fabric interface provides eight dedicated 
queues per port, mapped according to class of service (CoS) or 
DiffServ code point (DSCP) values. A WRED scheduler is used for 
congestion avoidance within each queue, while administrator-
configured strict and weighted round-robin priority options are 
available between queues on a single port. Multicast traffic is 
managed independent of unicast traffic.

Total buffer size is 512 MB on each EX8200-8XS 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet port or each EX8200-40XS port group, and 42 MB 
on each EX8200-48T and EX8200-48F Gigabit Ethernet port, 
providing 50-100 ms of bandwidth delay buffering. These deep 
buffers and ingress and egress queuing mechanisms are critical 
to managing mission-critical data, handling bursty traffic, 
and limiting TCP/IP retries at the application level to free up 
bandwidth, reduce latency and allow a higher quantity of both 
unicast and multicast application flows across the network.

All packets pass through the entire EX-PFE2 ingress pipeline, the 
switch fabric, and the EX-PFE2 egress pipeline. This consistency 
of packet processing ensures that the EX-PFE2 is capable of 
delivering port-to-port latencies of under 10 μs, regardless of 
ingress or egress port location. 

Up to 255 link aggregation groups (LAGs) are supported, 
ensuring that the large number of high-density Gigabit Ethernet 
LAGs found in campus and data center core and aggregation 
deployments can be accommodated. Up to 12 ports may be 
bundled into a single LAG, allowing 120 Gbps logical interfaces 
to be created using a full L2-L4 hash algorithm for optimal 
load balancing. Ports in a LAG may be distributed across line 
cards within an EX8200 switch for an added level of resiliency. 
Automatic detection, recovery, and redistribution of LAG traffic in 
the event of a port, link, or line card failure is supported for highly 
reliable connections. 

Each line card contains a local CPU that is connected to the 
chassis’ redundant Routing Engines over dedicated internal 
gigabit control-plane links. This CPU manages the local line card 
components, distributes forwarding table and other control plane 
data from the Routing Engine to the local EX-PFE2 ASICs, and 
returns line card status and CPU-directed control plane packets 
to the Routing Engine. A second processor resident on each line 
card aggregates flow-based statistics and analyzes sampled 
packets without impacting control plane performance. Finally, 
hot insertion and removal of all line cards is supported for online 
maintenance and support.
