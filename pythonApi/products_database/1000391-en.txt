QFX3100 QFabRIC
DIRECToR

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks QFabric System 
is composed of three separate 
but integrated components—the 
QFX3500/QFX3600 QFabric Nodes, 
the QFX3600-I/QFX3008-I QFabric 
Interconnect, and the QFX3100 
QFabric Director. These components 
work together to create a single, high-
performance QFabric architecture 
for the next-generation cloud-ready 
data center. The Juniper Networks 
QFX3100 Director provides central 
control and management services 
for the QFX3000 QFabric System, 
allowing the disparate devices 
to operate and be managed as a 
single, logical switch. This creates a 
simplified, single-tier network for the 
data center.  

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® QFX3100 QFabric Director serves as the central Routing Engine for the 
Juniper Networks QFX3000-M and QFX3000-G QFabric™ Systems, providing a single 
control and management services interface for the QFabric architecture.

Communicating directly with all QFabric Node and QFabric Interconnect devices, the 
QFX3100 Director builds a global view of the entire QFabric architecture, which can scale 
to support thousands of server-facing ports. Deployed in clusters, the QFX3100 provides 
network operators with a single point of visibility, control, provisioning, and management, 
presenting the entire data center network—built with QFabric Node and QFabric 
Interconnect devices—as a single switch. This dramatically reduces the operational costs 
typically associated with managing the complexities of today’s data center networks.

DATASHEETQFabric Architecture
by delivering a single-tier solution for the data center, the QFabric 
architecture combines the performance and simplicity of a single 
switch with the scale and resiliency of a network to enable any-
to-any connectivity while lowering capital, management, and 
operational expenses.

QFabric technology helps organizations realize the full benefit of 
their investments in server consolidation, virtualization, service-
oriented architecture (Soa), distributed application architectures, 
and other technologies. The high-performance, non-blocking, 
and lossless QFabric architecture delivers much lower latency 
than traditional network architectures—crucial for the high-speed 
communications that define the modern data center. 

Features and Benefits
a QFX3100 Director cluster enables a QFabric architecture to scale 
to thousands of customer-facing or business ports. In addition 
to imposing control plane scalability, the QFX3100 also ensures 
reliability and high availability at multiple levels when deployed 
in clusters for redundancy. In a QFabric Director cluster, QFX3100 
devices are connected directly to each other as well as to the larger 
fabric composed of QFabric Interconnects and QFabric Nodes via 
a control plane Ethernet network consisting of two independent 
Juniper Networks EX4200 Ethernet Switches deployed in a Virtual 
Chassis configuration. Should one of the QFX3100s fail, the other 
ensures continuity of fabric operations. 

The Director includes a front panel LCD screen for reporting device 
status at a glance or for performing device configuration via a 
menu-driven screen. a console port for out-of-band management 
and a USb drive for file storage are also available.

additional front panel slots support redundant 2 Tb hard drives 
for providing extra processing power. The two disk drives mirror 
data using RaID technology, providing for data redundancy on 
the Director. The QFX3100s synchronize the data stored, ensuring 
further availability in the event of a failure. 

The Director also includes two front panel slots that support 
4x1GbE interfaces for connecting to the QFabric solution’s 
Ethernet control plane. on the back panel, the QFX3100 includes 
redundant, hot-swappable 560 watt aC power supplies and 
redundant, hot-swappable fans. Internally, the QFX3100 includes 
a 2.1 GHz dual Intel Quad-Core processor with 36 Gb DRaM. 

QFabric solution management via a QFX3100 Director cluster 
integrates with existing data center management systems through 
powerful Juniper Networks Junos® SDK as well as the Junoscript 
and automation framework, which bring significant efficiencies to 
data center operations.

Junos Operating System
The QFabric family of products run the same reliable and high-
performance Juniper Networks Junos operating system that is 
used by Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, Juniper 
Networks routers, and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services 
Gateways. by utilizing a common operating system, Juniper 
delivers a consistent implementation and operation of control 
plane features across products. To maintain that consistency, 
Junos oS adheres to a highly disciplined development process, 
follows a single release track, and employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system. These attributes are fundamental to 
the core value of the software, enabling Junos oS-powered 
products to be updated simultaneously with the same software 
release. Features are fully regression tested, making each new 
releases a superset of the previous version; customers can deploy 
the software with confidence that existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.
