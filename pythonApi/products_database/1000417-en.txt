MX2000 3D Universal 
Edge Routers

Product Overview

As cloud builders, telecom 
service providers, and cable 
operators seek to improve 
customized digital experiences 
for their customers, they must 
concurrently address ever-
increasing bandwidth demands 
on their network.  Meeting these 
objectives requires a dynamic, 
service-oriented edge routing 
platform that cost-effectively 
scales to meet both current 
demand and long-term forecasts.

The SDN-ready MX2000 line of 
3D Universal Edge Routers helps 
network operators achieve their 
business goals by combining 
unparalleled performance and 
reliability with a programmable, 
software-centric design at 
massive scale.  Simply put, the 
MX2000 routers offer the greatest 
system capacity, the highest line-
rate port density, and the most 
full-featured edge service delivery 
platform available today. 

Product Description 
Increasingly sophisticated technology users are seeking highly responsive and customizable 
cloud-like online experiences and services that align with their unique needs and interests. 
At the same time, these users are creating more traffic that consume ever-increasing 
amounts of network bandwidth. For example, global e-commerce sales are growing at 20 
percent annually1; enterprises are increasingly moving infrastructure to the cloud2; every 
minute of every day, more than 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube3; and analysts 
expect 26 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices to be in use by 2020—more than a tenfold 
increase from 20154. 

As network operators strive to profitably meet these market demands, they are thwarted 
by traditional hardware-centric edge routers that lack programmability and scale, which 
limits their competitiveness, constrains their revenue and market share growth, and 
increases their CapEx, OpEx and TCO. Now more than ever, service providers need agile, 
service-oriented edge routers that cost-effectively scale to meet current demand and long-
term forecasts. 

Meeting these challenges head-on, Juniper Networks® MX2000 line of 3D Universal 
Edge Routers are service-rich platforms with the scale and performance to meet current 
demand and the most aggressive long-term forecasts. Consisting of the 80 Tbps-capable 
MX2020 and the 40 Tbps-capable MX2010 and MX2008, the MX2000 line enables 
network operators to confidently build the best network across residential, mobile, 
business, and cloud/hosting markets.

Significantly, the MX2000 platforms run the same Juniper Networks Junos® OS as the 
entire MX Series 3D router portfolio, ensuring complete feature consistency and a common 
operational and management framework. This consistency reduces the cost, risk, and 
complexity of network evolution, helping current MX Series customers rapidly qualify and 
deploy the MX2000 routers.

Data SheetArchitecture and Key Components

Platform Components 
Switch Fabric Board

Switch Fabric Boards (SFBs) create a highly scalable and 
resilient “all-active” centralized switch fabric that delivers up to 
2 Tbps of full-duplex switching capacity to each MPC slot in an 
MX2000 router. 

MS-MPCs, which also require an adapter card for use in the 
MX2000 line, provide dedicated processing for Network Edge 
Services (CGN, IPsec, stateful firewall, deep packet inspection 
[DPI], monitoring, and other compute-intensive services) and 
efficiently integrate these services directly on the MX2000 
platforms at scale and without impacting forwarding performance. 
MS-MPCs also reduce dependence on appliances and the layers 
of complexity they add to the operations environment.

Control Board and Routing Engine

Junos Operating System

Dual redundant Control Board and Routing Engines (CB-REs) 
run the 64-bit Junos OS and support routing protocol processing, 
router interface control, and control plane functions such as 
chassis component, system management, and user access 
to the router. These processes run on top of a kernel that 
interacts with the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) on Modular 
Port Concentrators (MPCs) via dedicated high-bandwidth 
management channels, providing a clean separation of the 
control and forwarding planes. 

Power

The MX2000 power and thermal subsystems use advanced 
technology to optimize power efficiency without sacrificing 
scale or features. The power subsystem has a highly resilient 
architecture for full power supply and power cable feed 
redundancy. MX2000 routers are available with -48 V DC or AC 
power (in Delta or Wye 3-phase configuration), and allow power 
to be added to the rack as needed. 

Modular Port Concentrators

Modular Port Concentrators (MPCs) provide comprehensive routing, 
switching, inline services, subscriber management, and advanced 
hierarchical quality of service (HQoS) to address the widest set 
of network and service applications. Some MPCs provide network 
connectivity directly; others host Modular Interface Cards (MICs) 
that allow users to mix-and-match interfaces.

The MPC6E, MPC8E and MPC9E are specifically designed to take 
advantage of the ultra-high fabric capacity of the MX2000 line. 
Powered by the programmable Junos Trio chipset, these MPCs 
offer extremely high 10GbE, 40GbE and 100GbE port densities 
with line-rate performance. The MPC9 is also 400GbE ready, 
providing a built-in migration path from 10GbE to 400GbE when 
the optics are available. These MPCs also stream telemetry for 
performance management and billing purposes.

An adapter card5 allows the use of the MPC1 through MPC5, as 
well as the MPC7E, in the MX2000 line, protecting existing MPC 
investments. Importantly, the MPC7E-10G provides per-port line 
rate MACSec Phy encryption/decryption, with no fragmentation 
impact.  This feature provides an inexpensive and simple 
mechanism to secure L2 communications. 

Junos is a reliable, high-performance, modular network operating 
system that is supported across all of Juniper Networks physical 
and virtual routing, switching, and security platforms, reducing 
the cost, complexity, and resources required to implement and 
maintain the network. With secure programming interfaces, the 
Juniper Extension Toolkit and versatile scripting support, and 
integration with popular orchestration frameworks, Junos OS 
offers flexible options for continuous delivery and DevOps style 
management that helps service providers of all types unlock 
more value from the network.

Unmatched Network Availability
The MX2000 line of 3D Universal Edge Routers offers a broad 
set of hardware and software features that together ensure 
nonstop network availability. The MX2000 line supports N+1 
fabric redundancy, control plane redundancy, N+N power feed 
redundancy, and even N+1 power supply module redundancy. 
In addition, Virtual Chassis technology supports chassis-
level redundancy while allowing users to manage two routers 
as a single element. Juniper’s link aggregation group (LAG) 
implementation also supports stateful card and port redundancy, 
as well as subscriber and session persistence. 

5  To provide optimal air flow and maximize interface density, MX2000 line MPC slots are wider than the MPC slots on the MX240, MX480, and MX960.  An Adapter Card enables MPC1 

through MPC5, MPC7 and MSMPC use in the MX2000 line; these cards require no configuration and are visible in the system inventory from the CLI.

Data SheetMX2000 3D Universal Edge RoutersFrom a software perspective, Junos OS runs each program 
independently in its own protected memory space, ensuring 
individual processes do not interfere with one another. Unified 
ISSU permits non-disruptive OS upgrades, while Junos Continuity 
allows new hardware to be added to an MX Series router with the 
addition of a simple plug-in package, which is installed fully in 
service without any interruption.

Embedded Element-Layer Analytics

The programmable Junos Trio chipsets provide the power to 
monitor and collect data at the component level, and use the 
Junos Telemetry Interface to stream this data in a scalable 
manner into monitoring, analytics, and performance management 
applications (see Figure 1), and to Path Computation Elements 
such as Juniper Networks NorthStar Controller.

MX2020 router and MPCs.

This information will help identify current and trending 
congestion, resource utilization, traffic volume, latency and delay, 
which service providers can use to detect issues, make informed 
decisions on network design, optimization and investment. 

Integrated Network Edge Services

Hosting Network Edge Services directly on MX2000 routers—
without impacting routing or forwarding performance—helps 
consolidate and eliminate service-specific appliances as well as 
their operating systems and management systems, which helps 
streamline operations and reduces TCO. 

Juniper’s Network Edge Services portfolio includes: 

•  Junos Address Aware, which conserves the IPv4 address 

pool, ensures IPv4/IPv6 coexistence, and aids in the 
transition to IPv6

•  Junos Network Secure, which provides stateful firewall 
services for network protection and managed security

•  Junos VPN Site Secure, which uses standard encryption 

modes to secure communications over access networks, and 
for added security over L3 VPNs

•  Junos Traffic Vision, which provides the granular traffic 

visibility needed to improve network efficiency, increase 
security, and support operational tasks

•  Junos Video Focus, which provides standards-based video 
monitoring and automatic issue mitigation to ensure high-
quality customer experiences

•  Junos Web Aware, a powerful application that tracks HTTP 

requests and responses, and enables tag insertion and 
header enrichment

•  Junos L4 Load Balancer, a hybrid traffic load balancer based 

on advanced Junos OS capabilities that increases network 
efficiency

Network Edge Services are optionally licensed individually; the 
MX2000 routers can host multiple services concurrently. Network 
Edge Services can be also be deployed on a Juniper Networks 
Service Control Gateway—an MX Series router running Junos 
Subscriber Aware and/or Junos Application Aware.

For more details on network edge services, see www.juniper.net/
us/en/products-services/network-edge-services/

Outstanding Power Design and Efficiency

The MX2000 line sets the bar for edge router power design 
and efficiency, increasingly important considerations for next-
generation network elements. 

At the system level, users can flexibly provision power to 
meet site-specific environmental conditions; less power can 
be provisioned in facilities that consistently operate at <25C, 
providing significant operational savings. Power consumption 
is also dynamically managed based on actual hardware 
configuration, only allocating additional power when a MIC is 
installed versus pre-provisioning power for worst-case scenarios. 
Additionally, fan speed is dynamically governed by actual 
temperature monitoring; at ambient temperature, fans consume 
only 20 percent of their maximum power. 

Juniper has also implemented power optimizations at the 
silicon level. “Clock gating” reduces dynamic power dissipation 
by disabling unused logic circuitry; unused memory is also 
dynamically placed in “sleep mode” to conserve power.

These optimizations, when coupled with Juniper’s most 
advanced MPCs and optics, enable the MX2000 line to achieve 
an incredible power-to-throughput efficiency ratio of .6W/GbE; 
this means the MX2020 consumes just six-tenths of a watt to 
forward 1GB of traffic.

Addresses Broadest Set of Service Provider 
Applications
Broadband Edge 

The MX2000 line offers powerful Broadband Network Gateway 
(BNG) features that allow broadband services to be provisioned 
for today and tomorrow, with support for Point-to-Point Protocol 
(PPP) subscriber termination, Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP), IPv4/IPv6 local server, and relay proxy for 
subscriber migration to DHCP access models. Juniper’s BNG 
also supports hierarchical queuing, granular QoS, and dynamic 
multilayer service activation, RADIUS, and diameter support for 
backend server integration to facilitate authentication, policy 
control, and accounting, as well as support for flexible L2/L3 
wholesale models.

Data SheetMX2000 3D Universal Edge RoutersBusiness Edge 

The MX2000 line of routers includes a comprehensive VPN 
toolkit to support feature-rich, standards-based, secure 
internetworking for innovative business services. In addition to 
basic L2/L3 VPN and VPLS support, the MX2000 line offers 
enhanced VPN services such as QoS-prioritized VPN traffic for 
voice and video, VPN-aware multicast and firewall services that 
leverage technologies such as LDP-BGP / VPLS internetworking, 
point-to-multipoint label-switched paths (P2MP LSPs), BGP-
based multicast L3VPN, L2 VPN internetworking to connect 
dissimilar L2 access networks, MPLS plug-and-play, and IPsec/
generic routing encapsulation (GRE) VPNs. 

Metro Ethernet

The MX2000 line of routers provides outstanding support for 
metro and aggregation networks by offering a full suite of routing 
and switching features, allowing network operators to choose a 
deployment model that fits their business and technical needs. 
The MX2000 line can be deployed as IP/IP VPN edge routers, 
Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) and VPLS provider edge routers (VPLS–
PE), MPLS label-switching routers (LSR), and as Layer 2 Ethernet 
switches or Layer 3 IP routers.

Universal SDN Gateway

The MX2000 routers are ideal universal SDN gateways, 
interconnecting virtual and physical networks and virtual 
networks operating with different technologies. Key enabling 
features include support for Multiprotocol BGP (MBGP), dynamic 
tunnels using MPLS-over-GRE or VXLAN encapsulation, virtual 
routing and forwarding (VRF) tables or E-VPNs, and Netconf, 
as well as mechanisms to send traffic between VRF and global 
routing tables based on configuration and policy. 

Service Control Gateway

The MX2000 line provides an excellent foundation for the Service 
Control Gateway, an advanced solution that considers network 
state, application type, subscriber privilege, and operator policy to 
deliver networked services. Leveraging Junos Application Aware, 
which uses deep-packet inspection techniques to identify and 
classify traffic on a per application basis, and Junos Subscriber 
Aware, which associates traffic flows with the subscriber 
that generated them, the Service Control Gateway supports 
differentiated service creation and delivery, and when used with 
Contrail Cloud Platform, can create and dynamically direct traffic 
into complex service chains.
