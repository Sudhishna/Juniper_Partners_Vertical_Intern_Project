SINGLE-PORT DOCSIS 
3.0 CABLE MODEM MINI-
PHYSICAL INTERFACE 
MODULE (MINI-PIM) 

Product Overview

The Juniper Networks single-port 
DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem Mini-Physical 
Interface Module (Mini-PIM) for the 
Juniper Networks SRX200 line provides 
DOCSIS 3.0 WAN connectivity for high-
speed data transfer over cable television 
networks with download speeds over 
150 Mbps. 

Product Description 
The DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem Mini-PIM is for use with the SRX200 line consisting of the 
Juniper Networks® SRX210 Services Gateway, SRX220 Services Gateway, and SRX240 
Services Gateway products. The Mini-PIM connects to a CMTS network via the single 
DOCSIS 3.0 interface. It is backwards compatible to DOCSIS 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0 protocols 
for flexibility to support multiple cable services with a single line. The DOCSIS 3.0 cable 
modem Mini-PIM has interoperability with leading vendor products. Please refer to Juniper 
Networks technical publications or your local Juniper Sales Representative or Reseller for 
the latest information on interoperability and supported cable operators.

LeDs 
Mini-PIM LEDs indicate port status with the following LED states:

•  Power—Green solid has been powered on and completed the 

power-on self-test (POST); red solid has failed the POST.

•  DT (Downstream)—Green blinking scans for a valid downstream 

DOCSIS channel to lock onto a downstream channel; green 
solid has locked onto the DOCSIS downstream channel.

•  UT (Upstream)—Green blinking scans for a valid upstream 

DOCSIS channel to lock onto an upstream channel; green solid 
has locked onto the DOCSIS upstream channel.

•  Link (to CMTS)—Green blinking has an active link with the CPE 
device, but data communication is not taking place. Green solid 
has an active link with the CPE device, and data communication 
is taking place. (Note:  The Link LED does not blink for data 
traffic that originates or terminates at the cable modem.)

•  Online—Green blinking has established a connection to the SRX 

Series device; green solid is synchronized with the SRX Series 
device.
