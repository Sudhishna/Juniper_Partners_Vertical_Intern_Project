XRE200 External  
Routing Engine 

Product Overview

The XRE200 External Routing 
Engine provides complete 
separation of the control and 
data planes in an EX8200 Virtual 
Chassis configuration, enabling a 
highly resilient network that can 
scale to support more than 3,000 
GbE or 640 10GbE connections. 

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® XRE200 External Routing Engine is a purpose-built, server-class 
appliance that works with internal Routing Engines (REs) on the Juniper Networks EX8200 
line of Ethernet switches to create a highly resilient architecture for supporting Virtual 
Chassis configurations based on the EX8200 line of modular switches.

By externalizing control plane functionality and separating it from the data plane running 
on the actual switch fabric, the XRE200 implements a highly reliable design that includes 
no single point of failure. The result is a scalable solution that  provides the additional 
processing power required to manage an EX8200-based Virtual Chassis configuration.

Juniper’s Virtual Chassis technology enables multiple interconnected switches to operate 
as a single, logical device. In the EX8200 line of Ethernet switches, Virtual Chassis 
technology greatly simplifies data center and campus core network configurations, 
management, and troubleshooting. Virtual Chassis technology in the EX8200 switches 
also minimizes or eliminates the need for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) while increasing 
network performance by enabling full utilization of all network uplinks.

Product Description
The XRE200 is a 2RU device that includes two slots for supporting 1GbE Virtual Chassis 
Control Interface (VCCI) modules. Two VCCI module options are available:

•  4-port 10/100/1000BASE-T RJ-45 module (included with the base XRE200 system)

•  4-port 1000BASE-X GbE SFP module (optional for extending the Virtual Chassis 

configuration up to 40 km)

On the front panel, the XRE200 includes an LCD screen for reporting device status at a 
glance or performing device configuration via a menu-driven screen; a 10/100/1000BASE-T 
RJ-45 port for XRE-to-XRE or XRE-to-Virtual Chassis connections;  
a console port for out-of-band management; and a USB drive for file storage.

Additional front panel slots are also available for supporting redundant 160 GB hard drives 
for providing extra processing power. On the back panel, the XRE200 includes redundant, 
hot-swappable 250 W AC power supplies and redundant, hot-swappable fans.

• 

Internally, the XRE200 includes a 2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor with 2 MB L2 
cache, 4 GB DRAM, and 4 GB of flash memory.

Data SheetArchitecture and Key Components
An EX8200-based Virtual Chassis configuration is composed 
of up to four EX8200 member switches—any combination 
of eight-slot EX8208s or 16-slot EX8216s—and two XRE200 
devices acting as active/standby devices for control plane and 
management plane redundancy.

XRE200 Features and Benefits
In addition to control plane scalability, the XRE200 ensures that 
if one or more switches in the Virtual Chassis configuration lose 
connectivity to the adjacent chassis, access switches connected 
to the EX8200 Virtual Chassis do not lose connectivity with the 
network. 

Ports on the VCCI modules connect to the EX8200 internal REs, 
either the EX8208-SRE320 or EX8216-RE320. One internal RE 
from each EX8200 chassis is connected to the active XRE200, 
while the second internal RE is connected to the standby 
XRE200. The two XRE200 devices can also be connected to 
each other directly via GbE interfaces.

An optional 1000BASE-X fiber VCCI module can be used to 
connect the active and standby XRE200 devices in environments 
where the distance between them exceeds the maximum span 
of unshielded twisted pair cable—for example, when the EX8200 
Virtual Chassis configuration is spread across two buildings.

Juniper Networks Junos® operating system high availability (HA) 
features such as GRES, NSR, and nonstop bridging (NSB) are 
enabled on the XRE200 devices in a Virtual Chassis configuration. 
In the event of an active XRE200 failure, the standby XRE200 
assumes the active role without impacting network state or 
forwarding behavior. Junos OS HA features ensure that the 
state of the Virtual Chassis, L2/L3 protocols, and forwarding 
information are not lost.

In addition, all Junos OS control plane protocols running on an 
EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration—including 802.3ad, OSPF, 
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Physical Interface 
Module (PIM), and BGP—also run on the XRE200, providing 
control plane scalability for large core deployments. The 
EX8200 and XRE200 use the Virtual Chassis Control Protocol to 
exchange Virtual Chassis state information.

The XRE200 also ensures that traffic flowing from one access 
switch to any other access switch or to any core/WAN router 
connected to the same EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration are 
not affected if the intra-Virtual Chassis connection fails.

Junos Operating System
The XRE200 runs the same Junos OS used by the Juniper 
Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well as all Juniper 
Networks routers and Juniper Networks SRX Series Services 
Gateways. By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper 
Networks delivers a consistent implementation and operation 
of control plane features across all products. To maintain 
that consistency, Junos OS adheres to a highly disciplined 
development process that uses a single source code, follows 
a single quarterly release train, and employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-powered products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version. Customers can deploy the software with 
complete confidence that all existing capabilities are maintained 
and operate in the same way.
