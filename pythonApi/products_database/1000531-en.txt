Product Description 
Juniper Networks® QFX10002 line of fixed configuration switches offers 72-port and 36-port 
40GbE options in a 2 U form factor, with support for 10GbE and 100GbE. Both switches 
support quad small form-factor pluggable plus transceiver (QSFP+) and QSFP28 ports for 
40GbE and 100GbE speeds, respectively. With support for 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE in 
a single platform, the QFX10002 switches provide the foundation for today’s data center, 
delivering long-term investment protection for current and emerging requirements. 

Built on custom, Juniper-designed Q5 ASICs, the high-performance, highly versatile 
QFX10002 switches scale from 2.88 Tbps to 5.76 Tbps of throughput. Additionally, by 
offering the industry’s highest 100GbE port density—up to 24 in a 2 U fixed form factor—
the QFX10002 enables a simple, consolidated network design and allows customers to 
seamlessly evolve data center networks from existing 10GbE and 40GbE architectures to 
100GbE to keep pace with evolving needs. 

The QFX10002 is a member of the QFX10000 line of Ethernet switches, which can be 
deployed in a number of different network designs and fabrics, including Layer 3 fabric and 
multichassis link aggregation (MC-LAG) for Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks, giving customers 
complete architectural flexibility. Additionally, the open architecture ensures that 
customers can innovate on top of Juniper Networks Junos® operating system to accelerate 
their pace of innovation. 

QFX10000 switches are also a key component of Juniper Networks MetaFabric™ 
Architecture, which provides a simple, open, and smart approach to building data center 
networks. Additionally, the QFX10000 switches support Data Center Interconnect (DCI), 
critical to workload mobility and application availability. 

For networks evolving to SDN, the QFX10000 switches can integrate with OpenContrail 
and VMware NSX SDN controllers, giving users options for SDN systems. The QFX10000 
performs both Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) L2 and L3 gateway functionality; the open, 
standards-based platform also interoperates with Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) to 
support automated management and control capabilities.

Architecture and Key Components
QFX10002 Switch Models

The QFX10002 line includes two fixed 2 U switch models, each 
providing wire-speed packet performance in 10GbE, 40GbE, 
or 100GbE speeds. Both switches provide a rich set of Junos 
OS features. In addition to a high throughput Q5 ASIC, the 
control plane performance on all QFX10002 switches is further 
enhanced with a powerful 2.5 GHz quad core Intel CPU and 16 GB 
of SDRAM.

•  QFX10002-36Q: The QFX10002-36Q 40GbE switch 

features 36 QSFP+ ports or 12 QSFP28 100GbE ports with 
two redundant 1600 W AC/DC power supplies and three 
fan trays. 

•  QFX10002-72Q: The QFX10002-72Q 40GbE switch offers 

72 QSFP+ ports or 24 QSFP28 100GbE ports with four 
redundant 1600 W AC/DC power supplies and three fan trays.

The Q5 ASIC

Figure 1: The custom-built Juniper Q5 ASIC

The QFX10002 switches are built with Juniper custom Q5 ASICs, 
which offer industry-leading performance and scale with 1 Tbps 
of switching throughput and support for network virtualization 
with VXLAN, Ethernet VPN (EVPN), and MPLS. The Q5 ASIC 
is 400GbE-ready and embedded with an on-chip analytics 
capability, along with a precision timing protocol and high-
frequency monitoring. 

Flexible Network Architectures

QFX10000 switches support a diverse set of deployment 
options, including L3 fabric and L2 and L3 networks with MC-
LAG. Customers can choose the architecture that best suits their 
deployment needs and easily adapt and evolve as requirements 
change over time. The QFX10002 switches serve as the universal 
building block for all of these switching architectures, enabling 
data center operators to build cloud networks their way.

•  Layer 3 Fabric: For customers looking to build scale-out 
data centers, a Layer 3 spine and leaf Clos fabric is ideal 
due to its nonblocking and predictable performance and 
scale characteristics. For example, a two-tier fabric with 
QFX10000 switches as the spine and QFX5100 switches as 
leafs can scale to support more than 6,900 10GbE server 
ports at 3:1 oversubscription.

  One of the most complicated tasks in building an IP fabric 

is assigning all of the details such as IP addresses, BGP 
autonomous system (AS) numbers, routing policy, loopback 
address assignments, and many other implementation 
details. The second largest problem is automating the 
creation of an IP fabric at a large scale. Juniper has created 
the OpenClos project to provide free and open-source 
tools to automate the creation of IP fabrics in the data 
center. OpenClos is a set of Python scripts that has been 
developed as an open-source project and lives on GitHub. 
OpenClos takes a set of inputs that describe the shape 
and size of a data center and it outputs network switch 
configuration files and even a cabling plan.

•  MC-LAG: QFX10000 switches eliminate Spanning Tree 

Protocol (STP) in traditional L2 networks when deployed 
in a MC-LAG configuration. The active/active operation of 
MC-LAG ensures complete bandwidth utilization between 
the network’s access and aggregation layers, while the 
dual control plane technology ensures highest availability 
for applications.

•  Overlays: Customers can deploy overlay networks to provide 
Layer 2 adjacencies for applications over Layer 3 fabrics. The 
overlay networks utilize VxLAN in the data plan and EVPN 
or OVSDB for programming the overlays. The overlays can 
operate without a controller or can be orchestrated with an 
SDN controller like OpenContrail or VMWare NSX. 

Carrier-Class Operating System

The QFX10000 switches run the same Junos OS used by all other 
Juniper Networks EX Series and QFX Series Ethernet Switches, 
as well as the Juniper Networks routers that power the world’s 
largest and most complex networks.

By using a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. Junos OS employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system. Key Junos OS features that enhance the 
functionality and capabilities of the QFX10000 switches include:

•  Software modularity, with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and 
with the ability to do process restarts

•  Uninterrupted routing and forwarding, with features such as 

nonstop routing (NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB)

•  Commit and rollback functionality, which ensures error-free 

network configurations

•  A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 

reporting, and resolution

Juniper Virtualized Open Network Operating  
System Framework

The QFX10000 switches have an open software architecture 
that enables customers to innovate along with Juniper to 
accelerate the pace of innovation. Customers can create and run 
applications alongside Junos OS; these applications can then 
follow their own software release schedule.

This new solution offers modularity and direct programmability 
through APIs. The platform and Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) 
modules are separate from the control module(s). Customers 
can create and run guest applications, either as a VM or a 
Linux process (daemon), alongside Junos OS. They can also 
communicate with Junos OS as well as directly with platform and 
PFE modules through normalized programmable APIs. Having 
the ability to build applications that can program the QFX10000 
control plane, data plane, and the platform itself, customers can 
implement specific and unique network forwarding functions 
and automate the control and management by integrating with 
their own SDN controller and orchestration tools. The QFX10000 

programmable APIs have a stable abstraction so that the 
customer’s applications can work across Juniper platforms as 
well as future Junos OS releases. Based on Apache Thrift, the 
QFX10000 switches support standardized API definition via 
Interface Description Language (IDL), while allowing users to 
employ their favorite programming language.

Other services such as analytics and automation can also run 
as separate processes (daemons) and can be directly accessed 
through orchestration tools. 

Junos Space Network Director

The QFX10000 switches can be managed through Juniper 
Networks Junos Space Network Director, a next-generation 
network management solution that allows users to visualize, 
analyze, and control the entire enterprise network—data center 
and campus, physical and virtual—through a single pane of glass. 
Network Director incorporates sophisticated analytics for real-
time intelligence, trended monitoring, and automation to increase 
agility and ensure faster rollout and activation of services.

Data SheetQFX10002 Fixed Ethernet Switches For cloud deployments, Network Director provides a set of REST 
APIs that enable on-demand and dynamic network services 
by simplifying the consumption of services for multitenant 
environments. With third-party cloud orchestration tool 
integration, the Network Director API enables automation and 
provisioning of L2, L3, and security services in the data center 
without the need for manual operator intervention.

Features and Benefits
Virtual Output Queue (VOQ)

The QFX10000 switches support a Virtual Output Queue (VOQ)-
based architecture designed for very large deployments. VOQ 
refers to a queue on the egress port that is maintained by the 
ingress PFE. With VOQ architecture, packets are queued and 
dropped on ingress during congestion with no head-of-line 
blocking.

Automation

QFX10000 switches support a number of network automation 
features, including operations and event scripts, automatic rollback, 
ZTP, and Python scripting. The switches also integrate with VMware 
NSX, OpenContrail, Puppet, OpenStack, and CloudStack. 

MPLS

QFX10000 switches support a broad set of MPLS features, 
including L3 VPN, IPv6 provider edge router (6PE, 6VPE), RSVP 
traffic engineering, and LDP to allow standards-based network 
segmentation and virtualization.  

VXLAN

QFX10000 switches support L2 and L3 gateway services that 
enable VXLAN-to-VLAN connectivity at any tier of the data 
center network, from server access to the edge. The QFX10000 
switches can integrate with VMware NSX through data plane 
(VXLAN) and control and management plane (OVSDB) 
protocols to centrally automate and orchestrate the data 
center network.

FCoE

As a Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch, the 
QFX10000 switches provide an IEEE data center bridging (DCB)-
converged network between FCoE-enabled servers and an FCoE-
enabled Fibre Channel storage area network (SAN). The switches 
offer a full-featured DCB implementation that provides strong 
monitoring capabilities for the SAN and LAN administration teams 
to maintain clear separation of management.  

The FCoE transit switch functionality, including priority-based 
flow control (PFC) and Data Center Bridging Capability Exchange 
(DCBX), are included as part of the default software.
