ACX Series Universal  
Access Routers

Product Overview

ACX Series Universal Access 
Routers bring operational 
intelligence to the access and 
aggregation layers, providing 
the option to deploy Ethernet 
or IP/MPLS infrastructure. 
High-precision synchronization 
technology, industry-leading 
security, and high availability 
features enhance QoE, while 
extensive OAM, built-in advanced 
SLA management, and zero 
touch deployment capabilities 
reduce TCO. ACX Series platforms 
address a variety of service 
provider use cases—including 
mobile backhaul, residential 
and business access, and metro 
Ethernet aggregation—as well as 
enterprise use cases for power 
utilities, oil and gas, mining, 
transportation, and defense and 
public safety industries. 

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® ACX Series Universal Access Routers are Juniper’s response to a shift 
in metro network architecture where the access and aggregation layer is extending the 
operational intelligence from the service provider edge to the access network. The ACX 
Series simplifies access and aggregation architectures by eliminating unnecessary layers 
and network overlays, dramatically reducing CapEx and OpEx. Based on architectural 
simplification and cost reduction, service providers and enterprises can adopt the true 
universal access paradigm enabled by the ACX Series. In addition to MEF CE2.0 compliance 
for supporting both Ethernet and IP/MPLS, the ACX Series provides high capacity and 
scalability while delivering industry-leading performance with a range of port densities and 
interface types. Table 1 provides a snapshot of interfaces supported on each ACX Series 
model. The flexibility and upgradability (mix and match of interface types) makes the ACX 
Series ideal for a wide range of use cases applications. 

Metro Ethernet
Carrier Ethernet services have been growing at double-digit rates over the past several 
years, and the trend is expected to continue—projected to reach over $70 billion revenue 
globally by 2020. Unabated network traffic growth driven by video and mobility, the 
continued shift from legacy TDM to IP, increased adoption of cloud services, and the arrival 
of smart cities and IoT (Internet of Things) all drive the demand for more Ethernet services 
given its lower cost per bit and bandwidth scalability. Meanwhile, Carrier Ethernet services 
are being provided by a wide range of service providers, and the increased competition 
has been putting pressure on the services price. To maintain profitability and compete 
effectively, service providers need a scalable universal metro Ethernet infrastructure to 
serve multiple customer segments with differentiated services.

•  Business Services—The ACX500, ACX1000 line, and ACX2000 line can be deployed 

as a CPE or NID to provide L2/3 business access, direct Internet access, and IP 
services such as IP VPN. The ACX Series features robust OAM and SLA control 
capabilities; together with automation and zero touch provisioning, the ACX Series 
enables seamless migration from 1GbE to 10GbE.

•  Residential Aggregation—The ACX5000 is a perfect candidate as a versatile 

metro aggregation platform. It supports high port densities and rich features such 
as Ethernet OAM for E-LINE, E-LAN, E-TREE over Ethernet or IP/MPLS, and IP VPN.  
The ACX5000 is also an excellent choice as a converged FTTH and metro Ethernet 
Services solution.

•  Wholesale Mobile Backhaul—In addition to MEF CE 2.0 compliance, supporting 

both Ethernet and IP/MPLS, the ACX Series provides high capacity and scalability, 
complete timing and synchronization, and integrated security and SLA tools 
that wholesale operators could use to differentiate for mobile backhaul services. 
Additionally, the ACX500 could be used as a last-mile deployment solution for a 
small cell as-a-service offering.

Mobile Backhaul and Fronthaul

The accelerating speed of innovation is forcing mobile operators 
to start planning for migration to LTE-Advanced now and 5G 
in the near future. LTE-Advanced and 5G place more stringent 
requirements for capacity, latency, synchronization, and security 
on the network infrastructure. 

Equipped with 1GbE/10GbE interfaces and providing up to 60 
Gbps of throughput, the ACX Series satisfies LTE-Advanced 
and 5G capacity requirements. In addition to high capacity 
and density to address scaling requirements, the ACX Series 
also addresses end-user quality requirements through high-
precision timing, advanced security features, and enhanced SLA 
management capabilities. 

Today, the ACX Series supports all mobile services profiles 
including 2G/3G HSPA, 4G LTE, LTE-Advanced, and Small Cell. 
In a typical backhaul deployment scenario, the ACX500 is used 
as a small cell router and grandmaster, whereas the ACX1000 

Table 1: Built-In Interface Options for Various ACX Series Models

line, ACX2000 line, or ACX4000 are macro cell site routers. The 
backhaul traffic carried over Ethernet or IP/MPLS is aggregated 
by the ACX5000 before it hits the mobile core. In a C-RAN 
deployment scenario, the ACX5000 could be used for fronthaul 
in a BBU model.

Enterprise Networking and Field Area Network

As enterprises and governments are embarking on their digital 
transformation journey, they need to deploy and upgrade their 
mission-critical communications networks, some of which are 
located in demanding and harsh environments such as the field 
area networks for providing SCADA system connectivity. These 
include power utilities, oil and gas, mining, rail and transportation, 
defense and public safety industries, etc.

The environmentally hardened small form factor ACX Series 
platforms deliver comprehensive routing and security services, 
application awareness and control, with high availability to ensure 
business continuity and resiliency, and they are perfect choices for 
supporting such mission-critical communications networks. The

Data SheetACX Series Universal Access RoutersArchitecture and Key Components
Powered by Juniper Networks Junos® operating system, the 
ACX Series routers complement Juniper Networks MX Series 3D 
Universal Edge Routers through a flexible and scalable service 
provider and enterprise branch routing portfolio optimized to 
support rapidly growing mobile, video, and cloud computing 
applications. The ACX Series introduces Juniper’s proven IP/
MPLS leadership from core and edge into the access layers of the 
network. Maintaining relative simplicity in the access network, 
the ACX Series supports a rich suite of L2, L3, and IP/MPLS 
functionality to allow large-scale seamless MPLS networks with 
simplified service provisioning and operations.

•  Seamless MPLS—ACX Series routers support both Ethernet 

bridging and MPLS. Growing demands in bandwidth are 
accompanied by network growth in terms of number 
of nodes. In some cases, we can see demands to scale 
a network up to tens of thousands of nodes. Seamless 
MPLS architecture enables scale and service flexibility by 
decoupling physical topology for transport and service 
layers. With a seamless MPLS architecture, service providers 
can leverage the existing investment of MPLS in the core 
and edge and extend the operational benefit into the 
access layer, enabling higher network service flexibility and 
higher scaling parameters of the MAN where metro Ethernet 
services can span across multiple network segments and be 
seamlessly terminated at any point of the network or cloud. 

•  Junos OS—Junos OS is a reliable, high-performance, 

modular network operating system that is supported across 
all of Juniper’s physical and virtual routing, switching, 
and security platforms. Junos OS improves network 
operations and increases service availability, performance, 
and security with features like low-latency multicast, 
comprehensive QoS, unified in-service software upgrade 
(unified ISSU), and Junos Continuity, which eliminates 
the risk and complexity of OS upgrades. Junos OS comes 
with embedded scripting tools and APIs, which enable 
automation of many routines and allow integration 
practically with any operator’s back-end management 
tools. With secure programming interfaces, the Juniper 
Extension Toolkit (JET), versatile scripting support, and 
integration with popular orchestration frameworks, Junos 
OS offers flexible options for DevOps-style management 
that can unlock more value from the network. 

•  Management—Junos Space Network Management 

Platform provides comprehensive management with broad 
fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security 
management (FCAPS) capabilities, for both device and 
service-level management. For device management, it 
supports NETCONF, CLI, SNMP v1/v2/v3 protocols, and its 
northbound APIs support easy integration with existing 
network management systems (NMS) and operations/
business support systems (OSS/BSS). Running on 
the Junos Space Management Platform, Junos Space 

Connectivity Services Director ensures effortless end-to-
end service provisioning of TDM, ATM, Carrier Ethernet 
(E-LINE, E-LAN, E-TREE, E-Access), VPLS, L3VPN, and 
MPLS, using a simple interface to design, validate, and 
manage these services. Another application of Junos Space, 
Cross Provisioning Platform (CPP) helps service providers 
provision E-LINE, Layer 2/3 VPN services, and virtual private 
LAN service (VPLS) between Juniper devices and those 
from third-party vendors.

Features and Benefits
The ACX Series delivers new levels of programmability, reliability, 
and scalability to the service provider and enterprise networks. 
The ACX Series portfolio improves customer satisfaction while 
lowering the total cost of operating, maintaining, and updating 
the network infrastructure. 

Zero Touch Deployment (ZTD)

Based on Junos OS automation capabilities, ACX Series routers 
support a zero touch deployment (ZTD) model. The ZTD 
model significantly minimizes the time for any new equipment 
installation and provisioning, resulting in lower OpEx and TCO 
and improved operational efficiency. In addition, the zero 
touch deployment model reduces the traditional complexity of 
deploying MPLS in the access. 

Integrated High-Precision Timing

The ACX Series incorporates1 highly scalable and reliable 
hardware-based timing technology, based on Juniper Networks 
intellectual property that meets the strictest LTE-A requirements 
for frequency and phase synchronization. Providing an accurate 
timing reference is one of the most significant technical and 
operational challenges for deployment of LTE radio access 
networks. ACX Series routers support Synchronous Ethernet for 
frequency as well as Precision Time Protocol (PTP) for both 
frequency and phase synchronization. Furthermore, the ACX 
Series allows Synchronous Ethernet and PTP to be used in a 
hybrid mode for the highest level of frequency (10 ppb) and 
phase (<500 nS) accuracy required for LTE-A. The ACX500, 
ACX500-O, and ACX500-O-PoE also provide an integrated 
GPS receiver and can act as a grandmaster (GM) clock for a 
distributed PTP implementation, making them an ideal choice 
for the aggregation of small cell traffic when the backhaul is 
transported over the Internet.

Advanced Security Services

One of the significant challenges in the rollout of small cells is 
to address the security threats from easily accessible locations. 
The ACX500 enables advanced security services such as 
IPsec, MACsec, NAT, and TPM to protect against potential 
vulnerabilities to the network as well as subscriber traffic. 
Hardware acceleration through a purpose-built services engine 
enhances the scalability of these computational-intensive 
services to support a large-scale small cell deployment.

Enhanced Service Assurance, SLA Management, 
and Ethernet OAM

The ACX Series routers provide the most comprehensive set 
of features. Using 802.3ah, 802.1ag, Y.1731, Two-Way Active 
Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) and RFC2544, mobile 
operators and wholesale service providers can make sure that 
the services being offered through ACX Series routers are meeting 
the desired service-level agreements.

Environmentally Hardened Design

Most of the ACX Series models such as ACX500, ACX1x00, 
and ACX2x00, are temperature hardened and support 
passive cooling for outdoor deployments in extreme weather 
conditions. The ACX500-O and ACX500-O-PoE are based 
on environmentally hardened, ruggedized chassis and are 
IP65 compliant for outdoor deployments with no need for an 
enclosure or cabinet. These are designed to be pole or strand 
mounted alongside outdoor small cells.

High Availability and Reliability

Junos Continuity and unified ISSU features remove the downtime 
risks associated with implementing new hardware or upgrading 
operating systems. Junos Continuity eliminates OS upgrades 
and system reboots when adding new hardware to ACX Series 
routers—a plug-in package provides the drivers and support 
files needed to bring the hardware online. Unified ISSU reduces 
the risks associated with OS upgrades by enabling upgrades 
between two different Junos OS releases (major or minor) with 
no control plane disruption and minimal traffic disruption on the 
forwarding plane.

MEF CE 2.0 Compliant

The ACX Series routers are all MEF CE 2.0 compliant and could 
support all Carrier Ethernet services, which include E-LINE, 
E-LAN, E-TREE, and E-ACCESS.

Full Feature Set of L2, L3, IP/MPLS

The ACX Series routers support a full feature set of L2, L3, and IP/
MPLS. Service providers can not only monetize Layer 2 Ethernet 
services, but also Layer 3, IP/IP-VPN services, etc., for greater 
monetization.
