The base-configuration EX8208 Ethernet Switch includes a 
side-mounted hot-swappable fan tray with variable-speed fans, 
one Switch Fabric and Routing Engine (SRE) module, and one 
dedicated Switch Fabric module. Base EX8208 switches also 
ship with either two 2000 watt or two 3000 watt power supplies, 
although six power supply bays allow users to provision the 
chassis to provide the power and redundancy required for any 
application. Redundant EX8208 configurations include a second 
SRE module for hot-standby resiliency while AC or DC power 
options provide complete redundancy, reliability, and availability. 
All components are accessible from the front, simplifying repairs 
and upgrades.

A front-panel chassis-level LCD panel displays Routing Engine 
status as well as chassis component alarm information for 
rapid problem identification and resolution to simplify overall 
operations. The LCD also provides a flexible, user-friendly

Deployment Scenarios
The EX8208 switch is optimized for both data center and 
campus aggregation and core deployments.

In the data center, the EX8208 switch delivers a high-
performance, high-density platform that reduces cost and 
complexity while improving overall scalability and providing 
carrier-class reliability. Populated with eight-port EX8200-8XS 
10-Gigabit Ethernet line cards, the EX8208 can accommodate 
large numbers of high-speed, line-rate uplinks at any packet size 
from access layer devices such as EX4200 switches deployed 
in Virtual Chassis top-of-rack configurations, offering a scalable 
solution for supporting more servers with fewer switches. Using 
the 40-port EX8200-40XS 10-Gigabit Ethernet line card, the 
EX8208 can support a similar number of servers using traditional 
standalone top-of-rack or blade-server switches.

Figure 2: A campus aggregation/core environment can be managed as a single device with an EX8208 Virtual Chassis configuration. 

With its high Gigabit Ethernet and 10-Gigabit Ethernet port 
densities, the EX8208 can also serve as an end-of-row server 
access switch. High-density Gigabit Ethernet and 10-Gigabit 
Ethernet ports on the EX8208 enable the consolidation 
of aggregation and core layers, simplifying the data center 
architecture while reducing power, space, and cooling 
requirements, and lowering total cost of ownership (TCO).

The EX8208 switch has a similar impact on campus aggregation 
and core environments, where high port densities and carrier-
class performance enable the switch to support more users with 
less equipment than traditional solutions. For example, EX4200 
switches deployed in Virtual Chassis configurations provide 
network access for every floor or building throughout a campus 
with 10-Gigabit Ethernet uplinks; the high-density EX8208 can 
aggregate Virtual Chassis uplinks within a single platform to 
provide high-performance, line-rate connectivity to core switches 
or WAN edge routers. 

Virtual Chassis Technology
The EX8208 supports Juniper Networks’ unique Virtual Chassis 
technology, which enables up to four interconnected EX8200 
chassis—any combination of EX8208s or EX8216s—to operate 
as a single, logical device with a single IP address.  Deployed as a 
collapsed aggregation or core layer solution, an EX8200 Virtual 
Chassis configuration creates a network fabric for interconnecting 
access switches, routers, and service-layer devices such as firewalls 
and load balancers using standards-based Ethernet LAGs.

In a Virtual Chassis configuration, EX8200 switches can be 
interconnected using either single line-rate 10GbE links or a LAG 
with up to 12 10GbE line-rate links. Since the Virtual Chassis intra-
connections use small form SFP+ interfaces, Virtual Chassis 

member switches can be separated by distances of up to 40 km 
(up to 70 km using ZR optics*). In a CWDM/DWDM network, the 
distance between member chassis can be extended beyond 70 
km. If the EX8200 Virtual Chassis switch members are located in 
the same or adjacent racks, low cost direct attach cables (DACs) 
can be used as the interconnect mechanism.

Since the network fabric created by an EX8200 Virtual Chassis 
configuration prevents loops, it eliminates the need for protocols 
such as Spanning Tree. The fabric also simplifies the network 
by eliminating the need for Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol 
(VRRP), increasing the scalability of the network design. In 
addition, since the Virtual Chassis Control Protocol (VCCP) 
used to form the EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration does not 
affect the function of the control plane, Junos OS control plane 
protocols such as 802.3ad, OSPF, Internet Group Management 
Protocol (IGMP), Physical Interface Module (PIM), BGP and 
others running on an EX8200 Virtual Chassis system behave in 
exactly the same way as when running on a standalone chassis.

EX8200 Virtual Chassis configurations are highly resilient, with no 
single point of failure, ensuring that no single element—whether a 
chassis, a line card, a Routing Engine, or an interconnection—can 
render the entire fabric inoperable following a failure.  Virtual 
Chassis technology also makes server virtualization at scale 
feasible by providing simple L2 connectivity over a very large pool 
of compute resources located anywhere within a data center.

Virtual Chassis technology can also be used to extend EX8200-
based VLANs between data centers by placing an equal number 
of switches in both data centers, or by interconnecting two 
separate Virtual Chassis configurations using a simple L2 trunk.

Data SheetEX8208 Ethernet SwitchXRE200 External Routing Engine
In an EX8200 Virtual Chassis configuration, the Routing Engine 
functionality is externalized to a purpose-built, server-class 
appliance, the XRE200, which supports control plane processing 
requirements for large-scale systems and provides an extra layer 
of availability and redundancy.

All control protocols such as OSPF, IGMP, Link Aggregation 
Control Protocol (LACP), 802.3ah and VCCP, as well as all 
management plane functions, run or reside on the XRE200.  
Junos OS high availability (HA) features can be enabled on the 
two XRE200s required in a redundant EX8200 Virtual Chassis 
configuration. In the event of an active XRE200 failure, the 
standby XRE200 takes over and Junos OS HA features ensure 
that the state of the Virtual Chassis, L2/L3 protocols, and 
forwarding information are not lost.  See the XRE200 data sheet 
for more information.

Architecture and Key Components
The EX8200 line of Ethernet switches feature a number of 
distinct architectural elements. The Routing Engine on the SRE 
module runs Junos OS, which processes all Layer 2 and Layer 3 
protocols and manages individual chassis components, while 
the Switch Fabric module provides the central crossbar matrix 
through which all data traffic passes. The SRE and Switch Fabric 
modules work together to fulfill all Routing Engine and Switch 
Fabric functions.

The EX8200 line cards include ASIC-based packet forwarding 
engines—the EX-PFE2— that process network traffic at wire 
rate, as well as a line-card processor that provides scalable local 
control and status processing. The EX8208 chassis backplane 
distributes the data, control, and management plane signals 
over independent paths to the various system components and 
distributes power throughout the system. The fan tray provides 
cooling to the line cards and control modules with redundant 
variable-speed fans, while the power supplies convert building 
power to the internal voltage required by the system.

All EX8208 components are hot-swappable, and all central 
functions are available in redundant configurations, providing high 
operational availability by allowing continuous system operation 
during maintenance or repairs. 

Switch Fabric and Routing Engine  
(SRE) Module
The EX8208 SRE module performs two functions:  it incorporates 
switch fabric, control plane, and management plane functionality 
on a single module, and it includes an integrated Routing Engine 
featuring a 1.2 GHz processor with 2 gigabytes of DRAM and 2 
gigabytes of Flash storage. A dedicated front-panel RJ-45 Gigabit 
Ethernet port on the SRE module supports out-of-band system 
management and monitoring, while an external USB port allows 
easy uploading and storage of software images, configuration 
files, and logs. Direct console access is available through a 
dedicated serial port; an auxiliary console interface can support 
remote modem access to the switch.

The Routing Engine on the SRE module is based on the field-
proven hardware architecture used by Juniper Networks routers, 
bringing the same carrier-class performance and reliability 
to the EX8208 that Juniper’s routers provide to the world’s 
largest service provider networks. The Routing Engine’s central 
CPU performs all system control functions and maintains the 
hardware forwarding table and routing protocol states for 
the EX8208 switch. Dedicated hardware on the SRE module 
supports chassis management functions such as environmental 
monitoring, while communication between SRE modules and 
individual EX8200 line cards takes place over a dedicated 
internal Gigabit Ethernet out-of-band control interface. 

EX8208 Switch Fabric
The switch fabric for the EX8208 switch, which serves as the 
central non-blocking matrix through which all network data 
passes, is distributed across three elements:  the dual-redundant 
SRE modules and the dedicated Switch Fabric module. Working 
together, the SRE and Switch Fabric modules deliver the 
necessary switching capacity for the EX8208 switch; when the 
second SRE module is present, the additional switch fabric serves 
in hot-standby mode, providing full 2+1 switch fabric redundancy. 
The Switch Fabric modules are hot-swappable and field-
replaceable, enabling failed units to be easily replaced without 
service interruption.

The two active, load-sharing switch fabrics on the SRE and 
Switch Fabric modules collectively deliver up to 320 Gbps 
(full-duplex) of packet-data bandwidth per line-card slot. The 
EX8208 switch backplane is designed to support a maximum 
fabric bandwidth of 6.2 Tbps.

Data SheetEX8208 Ethernet SwitchPower
The EX8208 chassis contains six power supply bays and 
supports three types of power supplies, providing complete 
flexibility for both provisioning and redundancy. Each AC power 
supply delivers 2000 watts of power at high-line (12 A at 200-
240 V) or 1200 W at low-line (15 A at 100-120 V) to the chassis. 
The EX8208 also supports a 3000 W power supply for high-
line operation.  A redundant-input 2000 W DC power supply 
is also available for central office deployments. The EX8200 
power supplies are more than 90 percent efficient at a wide 
range of loads, minimizing building power requirements and 
reducing overall power consumption. These power supplies are 
interchangeable across the EX8200 line, simplifying maintenance 
and sparing.

Although only two power supplies are required for basic 
configuration and switch power-up, the six power supply bays 
provide the capacity required to power all possible line-card 
configurations, and to support N+1 or N+N power redundancy 
to protect against both component and line input failures. The 
actual number of power supplies required depends on the 
combination of line cards installed and the desired level of 
redundancy (see Table 2). For example, 6000 W is required to 
support a chassis fully populated with 64 10-Gigabit Ethernet 
ports, while 3600 W will support various 10-Gigabit Ethernet and 
Gigabit Ethernet line-card combinations.

Features and Benefits
High Availability

The EX8208 switch delivers a number of high availability features 
to ensure uninterrupted, carrier-class performance.

The EX8208 switch features an extra slot to accommodate a 
second SRE module, providing N+1 redundancy. When a second 
SRE module is present, the integrated Routing Engine serves as a 
backup in hot standby mode, ready to take over in the event of a 
master RE failure. Should the master fail, an integrated Layer 2 and 
Layer 3 Graceful Route Engine Switchover (GRES) feature, working 
in combination with the NSR and NSB features, seamlessly 
transfers control to the backup, maintaining uninterrupted access 
to applications, services, and IP communications.

Carrier-Class Operating System

The EX8208 chassis-based switch runs the same Junos OS used 
by other EX Series switches, as well as the Juniper Networks 
routers used to power the world’s largest and most complex 
networks.

By utilizing a common operating system, Juniper Networks 
delivers a consistent implementation and operation of control-
plane features across all products. To maintain that consistency, 
Junos OS adheres to a highly disciplined development process 
that uses a single source code, follows a single quarterly release 
train, and employs a highly available modular architecture that 
prevents isolated failures from bringing an entire system down.

These attributes are fundamental to the core value of the 
software, enabling all Junos OS-based products to be updated 
simultaneously with the same software release. All features are 
fully regression-tested, making each new release a true superset 
of the previous version; customers can deploy the software 
with complete confidence that all existing capabilities will be 
maintained and operate in the same way.

Simplified Management and Operations
A range of system management options are available for the 
EX8208 switches. 

The standard Junos OS CLI provides the same granular 
management capabilities and scripting parameters found in all 
Junos OS-based products. The EX8208 switches also include the 
integrated Junos Web management tool, an embedded device 
manager that allows users to configure, monitor, troubleshoot, 
and perform device-level maintenance on individual switches 
via a browser-based graphical interface. In addition, integrated 
Junos XML management protocol tools provide early detection 
and automatic resolution of potential problems related to the 
operating system.
