Cloud Analytics Engine

Product Overview

Cloud Analytics Engine is a 
next-generation analytics tool 
designed for complex, dynamic 
data centers of any size. Using 
network data analysis to improve 
application performance and 
availability, Cloud Analytics 
Engine performs data collection, 
correlation, and visualization to 
help customers better understand 
workload and application 
behavior across the physical and 
virtual infrastructure. 

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® Cloud Analytics Engine provides “network context” to applications. As 
more and more applications are moved to public and private clouds, security, application 
performance, and application availability are becoming significant challenges. With 
the growth of network virtualization, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as 
a Service (SaaS) offerings, public, private, and hybrid clouds, and the proliferation of 
business-critical applications running in the cloud, networks have to be more flexible and 
application-aware than ever to dynamically meet service-level agreements (SLAs). 

While traditional network diagnostic tools like SNMP, CLI, or traceroute are useful, they were 
designed for static networks that supported silos of applications. Modern data centers, on 
the other hand, are all about agility, flexibility, efficiency, and simplicity, requiring a new set 
of tools that can help customers deal with these emerging requirements. Cloud Analytics 
Engine provides an aggregated and detailed level of visibility, tying applications and the 
network together to deliver an application-centric view of network status, improving 
customers’ ability to quickly roll out new applications and troubleshoot problems.

Data SheetArchitecture and Key Components
Cloud Analytics Engine consists of the following key software 
components:

•  Cloud Analytics Engine Junos OS component: Built into 
Juniper Networks Junos® operating system releases on 
supported Juniper switches, this software component 
processes requests from the Compute Agent to collect 
data, which is then sent to the Compute Agent.

•  Compute Agent: Installed on virtual or bare-metal compute 

nodes, the Compute Agent works with the Cloud Analytics 
Engine Junos OS component to collect and configure the 
requested data from network devices. The Compute Agent 
is controlled by either an API or by the Data Learning Engine 
component.

•  Data Learning Engine: An optional software component 

installed on compute nodes that store structured data 
collected from the Compute Agent, the Data Learning 
Engine provides longer storage and additional processing 
of network analytics data. The engine also provides 
a REST API for integrating with Junos Space Network 
Director, allowing the application to configure analytics 
data collection and visualize network analytics data. 
Other applications can also use the REST API to integrate 
with Cloud Analytics Engine. For information on how 
Cloud Analytics Engine works with Network Director, 
please visit www.juniper.net/assets/us/en/local/pdf/
datasheets/1000428-en.pdf.

Cloud Analytics Engine Workflow
Cloud Analytics Engine features the following workflow:

1.  Generating cloud analytics data: The Cloud Analytics 

Engine can start generating data using Network Director, 
the Data Learning Engine REST API, or the Compute Agent 
API. Customers can select the data they want to generate 
by specifying an application flow or a Virtual Extensible LAN 
(VXLAN) tunnel to monitor. Each device in the path of a 
monitored application flow or tunnel that supports the Cloud 
Analytics Engine generates cloud analytics data for that flow 
or tunnel.

2.  Viewing or collecting the generated data: Customers can 

use Show commands on networking devices to view certain 
cloud analytics data. Like generating data, there are different 
ways to collect cloud analytics data: Network Director, the 
Data Learning Engine REST API, or the Compute Agent 
API. Customers can select the data they want to collect by 
specifying an application flow or a VXLAN tunnel.

3.  Viewing the collected data: Both the Compute Agent API 

and the Data Learning Engine REST API return analytics data 
in JSON format. Network Director reads the data and displays 
the information in a format that allows the user to visualize it. 
Any other third-party tool can be used to view collected data 
through open and standard API interfaces.

Data SheetCloud Analytics EngineFeatures and Benefits
Cloud Analytics Engine enables:

•  Application visibility and performance management by 

controlling application flows and workload placement

•  Capacity planning and optimization by detecting hotspots 

and monitoring latency and microbursts

•  Troubleshooting and root cause analysis by correlating 

overlay and underlay network

Figure 3: Cloud Analytics Engine use cases

The Cloud Analytics Engine can be used by different IT teams, 
either independently or in collaboration, to troubleshoot root 
cause application or network performance and availability 
problems, eliminating finger pointing between groups while 
improving IT efficiency and reducing costs. 

End-to-End Network Visibility and Flow Path 
Analysis

The Cloud Analytics Engine provides network data analysis to 
improve application performance and availability by associating 
flows with specific applications across the physical and virtual 
infrastructure. This enhances the ability to quickly roll out new 
applications and troubleshoot problems. The Cloud Analytics 
Engine not only shows paths but also end-to-end, hop-by-hop 
latency for the application. It also detects microbursts in the 
network and identifies specific applications impacted by the activity 
(see Figure 4).

Network and Host Statistics

The Cloud Analytics Engine collects hop-by-hop network and 
host statistics in addition to flow path (see Figure 5).

Overlay-Underlay Correlation

As networks get virtualized, it becomes harder to troubleshoot 
without having visibility into both the overlay and underlay 
infrastructure. The Cloud Analytics Engine not only provides 
overlay visibility, it helps network administrators correlate overlay 
issues to the specific underlay network entity that is causing the 
problem, reducing the time required to troubleshoot issues that 
arise with network virtualization (see Figure 6).

The Cloud Analytics Engine also shows all VXLAN virtual tunnels 
across the network, along with virtual machine (VM) information 
that is carried across specific virtual tunnels.

Unsupported Juniper or Third-Party Devices

For Cloud Analytics Engine to provide complete end-to-end 
visibility, all networking devices must support the Cloud Analytics 
Junos OS component in order to communicate with the Compute 
Agent probes. The Cloud Analytics Engine will work with devices 
that do not support this component, including non-Juniper 
devices, in the application flow path, but the only data it will 
collect from them is their IP address and hop number.
