Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® single-port synchronous serial Mini-PIM provides the physical 
connection to serial network media types, receiving incoming packets from the network and 
transmitting outgoing packets to the network. The single-port synchronous serial Mini-PIM 
forwards packets for processing while performing framing and line-speed signaling.

Features and Benefits
The Juniper Networks single-port synchronous serial Mini-PIM provides increased 
bandwidth capabilities while making effective use of the SRX200 line interface slots. 
Features include:

•  60-pin synchronous serial (female) connector type
•  Support for the following standards: TIA/EIA 530, V.35, X.21, RS-232, RS-449
•  Up to 8 Mbps per physical port
•  Clock rate configurable
•  Crypto resynchronization support
•  Juniper’s proprietary data terminal equipment (DTE) and data circuit-terminating 

equipment (DCE) cables available for each protocol (10 in all) with auto-detection for 
DTE/DCE modes
