QFX10000 Coherent DWDM 
Line Card  

Product Overview 

Part of Juniper’s Open Cloud 
Interconnect solution, the 
QFX10000 Coherent DWDM 
Line Card is an extension of 
Juniper’s flagship QFX10000 
line of Switches. Installed in 
the modular QFX10008 and 
QFX100016 switching platforms, 
the QFX10000 Coherent DWDM 
Line Card helps customers achieve 
operational simplicity by providing 
a single interface for managing IP 
and DWDM without compromising 
density and security.

 

Product Description
Distributed cloud applications, video streaming, and mobile applications are causing an 
explosion in data center traffic growth, creating the need to interconnect geographically 
dispersed locations to create a single hyperscale logical resource pool. 

To achieve this interconnectivity, cloud operators are deploying isolated packet and 
dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) equipment as separate domains with 
independent management tools. Integrating DWDM into Juniper Networks® QFX10000 line of 
Switches eliminates these operational silos by bringing packet and optical into a converged 
architecture, while the integration of coherent optics into the QFX10000 Switches reduces 
space and power consumption and eliminates the high cost of external transponder shelves. 

The high availability and traffic engineering features available on the QFX10000 Switches 
complement integrated coherent DWDM into a single multilayer Data Center Interconnect 
(DCI) environment, all managed by Juniper Networks Junos® operating system. The 
modular QFX10000 Switches, the QFX10008 and QFX10016, offer up to 19.2 Tbps of 
DWDM capacity in a single system with line-rate encryption. The six-port QFX10000 
Coherent DWDM Line Card is equipped with flex modulation technology, enabling 200 
Gbps, 150 Gbps, or 100 Gbps line rates to support cloud data center applications such 
as cloud interconnect, metro connect, and enhanced disaster recovery. The line card also 
supports line-rate Ethernet protocols, Layer 3, MPLS, and Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) 
features used to create Layer 2 or Layer 3 services over a DWDM network. 

The QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card is built on Juniper Networks Q5 silicon, which, 
in addition to rich L2 and L3 Ethernet features, offers the large logical scale and deep 
buffers required for collapsed DCI deployments. The QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line 
Card will interoperate with any Ethernet client cards and any common components of the 
QFX10000 line’s chassis.

Architecture and Key Components
Integrated DWDM Solutions for the Open Cloud 
Interconnect Solution

The QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card integrates rich L2 and 
L3 packet features, scale, security, and high-density DWDM in a 
single line card to dramatically simplify cloud connectivity. Today, 
cloud operators maintain dedicated network layers for the spine 
and data center edge, driving capital and operating costs higher. 

The feature-rich QFX10000 helps data center operators simplify 
their networks by collapsing multiple layers such as spine and 
optical DCI into a single platform. This architecture eliminates 
dedicated transponder shelves and removes the costs associated 
with 100GbE client optics between Ethernet line cards and 
transponder chassis, providing a common interface for managing 
both IP and DWDM layers. 

200 Gbps DWDM and MACsec in the QFX10000: 
Powering Open Cloud Interconnect

The QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card integrates 
transponders into the switching platform, providing state-of-the-
art compensation dispersion using soft-decision forward error 
correction (FEC) support. Supporting distances from 120 to 4000 
km, the QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card addresses a wide 
range of use cases spanning metro, regional, and long-haul cloud 
interconnect architectures. Highly configurable, the same line 
card will support both metro applications of less than 120 km 
without amplification and long-haul applications up to 4000 km 
with amplification.

Line-rate MACsec encryption is built into the line card, ensuring 
that all traffic will be securely encrypted at any distance needed 
over third-party optical line systems (OLS). The QFX10000 
Coherent DWDM Line Card provides a YANG API, enabling easy, 
standards-based integration into third-party controllers or 
into turnkey solutions such as Juniper Networks proNX Service 
Manager for end-to-end optical provisioning. 

In addition to DWDM and MACsec support, the QFX10000 Coherent 
DWDM Line Card employs Q5 silicon to further enhance cloud 
interconnect deployments with L2 and L3 services over DWDM, 
including VXLAN, Ethernet VPN (EVPN), BGP, and MPLS features.

Features and Benefits
QFX10000 Modular Switches

The QFX10000 line of industry-leading switches offers a highly 
scalable, high-density network foundation for spine applications, 
supporting today’s most demanding data center and cloud 
environments. With the addition of the Coherent DWDM Line 
Card, customers can further simplify data center operations 
and reduce costs by collapsing multiple network layers into a 
converged DCI architecture. 

Each QFX10000 Ethernet line card is unique in its ability to 
support tri-speed 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE connections. This 
enables customers to transition seamlessly from one speed to 
another as their needs change. The unprecedented port density, 
high logical table sizes, and up to 100 ms deep packet buffers 
allow customers to deploy the most scalable systems necessary 
to meet the exponential data growth in the data center.

Each QFX10000 line card is built upon the Juniper Q5 silicon, 
which supports a wide range of L2 and L3 Ethernet functionality 
such as 802.1Q VLAN, VXLAN, link aggregation, Virtual Router 
Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), L2 to L3 mapping, and port

monitoring. Additionally, the line cards support filtering, sampling, 
load balancing, rate limiting, class of service (CoS), MPLS, Fibre 
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit functionality, and other 
key features needed to deploy a dependable, lossless, high-
performance Ethernet infrastructure. 

Secure DWDM Transport

The QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card supports line-rate 
100GbE MACsec encryption on all ports up to 1.2 Tbps, with a 
built in advanced Layer 2 encryption engine based on standard 
IEEE 802.1AE, 256-bit, and 128-bit Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES) algorithms to offer end-to-end security over 
the DWDM transport network. The MACsec integration on the 
QFX10000 Coherent DWDM Line Card eliminates the need for 
dedicated appliances and provides privacy and confidentiality 
with replay protection for sensitive tenant data traffic before 
leaving the cloud data center premises. MACsec support also 
includes both static connectivity association key (CAK) and 
dynamic CAK authentication. 

The MACsec feature is available on all ports to provide maximum 
security for cloud interconnects. No additional licenses are 
required to enable this feature.
