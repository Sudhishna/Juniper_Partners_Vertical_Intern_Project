Product Overview

The Juniper Networks 8-port small 
form-factor pluggable transceiver 
(SFP) XPIM provides high-density 
Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for the 
Juniper Networks SRX550 and SRX650 
Services Gateway products, increasing 
flexibility and operational ease.

8-PORT SFP (GIGABIT 
ETHERNET) PHYSICAL 
INTERFACE MODULE 
(XPIM)

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® SRX550 and SRX650 Services Gateways, in conjunction with the 
8-port SFP XPIM, offer customers the flexibility of deploying high-density LAN and WAN 
services in their branch, data center, and metro Ethernet networks. Juniper’s 8-port SFP 
XPIM for the SRX Series complements the onboard 10/100 and 10/100/1000 Ethernet 
interfaces with high-density fiber and copper Gigabit Ethernet connectivity choices for 
Layer 2 and Layer 3 services. It offers support for a variety of transceiver types, including 
short wavelength for GbE connectivity over multimode fiber, long wavelength for GbE 
connectivity over multimode and single mode fiber, 100BASE-FX for Fast Ethernet 
connectivity over multimode and single mode fiber, and 1000BASE-T for GbE connectivity 
over twisted pair. 

Architecture and Key Components
The 8-port SFP XPIM provides highly flexible interfaces that give the network designer the 
tools to solve a wide variety of networking problems. 

Network Segmentation
The XPIMs can be used to subnet or segment network traffic by configuring each Ethernet 
port as a separate routed network or subnet. This localizes broadcast and multicast traffic 
to a local segment and allows different security policies to be applied to each subnet. 
Alternatively, XPIM ports can be assigned to VLANs in Layer 2 switching mode to provide 
delineation and segmentation of the L2 broadcast domain. 

Security Zones
Many organizations need to improve internal security and keep critical information private 
within departments. At the same time, they need to provide guest access and protect 
local resources. The XPIMs give the network designer the extra Ethernet ports necessary 
to implement security zones for departmental access.

Local Workgroups
The network designer can use the Ethernet switching capability of the XPIMs to create 
local workgroups. Integrating L2 switching in the SRX650 and SRX550 gateways saves 
space and simplifies management by using a single user interface to configure the switch 
and the SRX Series devices.
