form-factor, multicore blade and rack servers. The greater 
compute capacity and server densities enabled by these devices 
are increasing traffic levels, creating the need for high-speed, 

1 550 ns is for 40GbE to 40GbE mode only

*Roadmap

Data SheetQFX5100 Application Acceleration Switchlow-latency, storage- and I/O-converged networking solutions 
that can maximize performance for physical servers, virtual 
servers, and storage in the data center. 

An immense amount of compute power is required to process 
these applications, which often need to interact with other 
applications on different servers to complete a single task. 
Switching between different compute resources leads to higher 
application latency—intolerable in use cases such as high 
frequency trading and Hadoop clusters. The QFX5100-24Q-AA 
with PFA module accelerates application processing by performing 
certain compute tasks on a hardware acceleration platform, 
lowering latency, improving performance, and lowering the cost of 
procuring additional compute resources. 

The greatest benefit of an FPGA is its ability to perform 
customized processing, as well as the flexibility to change and 
reprogram logic as needs change. Fixed pipeline ASICs such 
as the PFE on the QFX5100 are designed for fast switching 
and routing of packets based on L2 and L3 headers. Functions 
that typically occur at L4 or above—such as Network Address 
Translation (NAT), packet encryptions, and load balancing—can 
easily be implemented on the QFX-PFA-4Q expansion module. 

Junos OS
All QFX5100 switches run Junos OS, Juniper’s powerful and 
robust network operating system. 

The Junos operating system features the most advanced and 
robust routing capabilities in the industry. All QFX5100 switches 
include support for RIP and OSPF for both IPv4 and IPv6 in 
the base software. Advanced capabilities such as IS-IS, BGP, 
LDP, RSVP, and BGP-LU are also supported. With additional 
capabilities like 64-way equal-cost multipath (ECMP) and BGP 
add path, QFX5100 is an ideal building block for deploying the 
most robust L3 underlay for software-defined networks (SDN) 

In addition to advanced features, Junos OS has the following 
additional attributes:

•  Software modularity with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and 
with the ability to do process restarts

•  Uninterrupted routing and forwarding with features such as 

nonstop routing (NSR) and nonstop bridging (NSB)

•  Commit and rollback functionality that ensures error free 

network configurations 

•  A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 

reporting, and resolution

Junos Space Network Director 
The QFX5100 switches can be managed through Junos Space 
Network Director, a next-generation network management 
solution that allows users to visualize, analyze, and control the 
entire enterprise network—data center and campus, physical 

and virtual, wired and wireless—through a single pane of glass. 
Network Director incorporates sophisticated analytics for real-
time intelligence, trended monitoring, and automation to increase 
agility as well as enabling faster rollout and activation of services.

For cloud deployments, Network Director provides a set of REST 
APIs that enable on-demand and dynamic network services 
by simplifying the consumption of services for multitenant 
environments. With third-party cloud orchestration tool 
integration, the Network Director API enables automation and 
provisioning of L2, L3, and security services in the data center 
without the need for manual operator intervention.

Features and Benefits
Topology-Independent In-Service-Software 
Upgrade (TISSU)
With its Intel core processor, the QFX5100-24Q-AA Application 
Acceleration switch allows Junos OS to run within a VM on Linux. 
Junos OS runs in two separate VMs in active and standby pairs; 
during software upgrade cycles, the switches seamlessly move to 
the newer software version while maintaining intact data plane 
traffic. This true topology-independent ISSU, an industry-first 
software upgrade feature for a fixed-configuration top-of-rack 
switch, is supported across all L2 and L3 protocols and doesn’t need 
the support of any other switches to perform an image upgrade.

Automation

The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch supports 
a number of features for network automation and plug-and-play 
operations. Features include zero touch provisioning, operations 
and event scripts, automatic rollback, and Python scripting. The 
switch also offers support for integration with VMware NSX Layer 
2 Gateway Services, Puppet, and OpenStack. 

Flexible Forwarding Table
The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch’s Flexible 
Forwarding Table (FFT) allows the hardware table to be carved 
into configurable partitions of L2 media access control (MAC), 
L3 host, and longest prefix match (LPM) tables. In a pure L2 
environment, the switch supports 288,000 MAC addresses. In 
L3 mode, the table can support 128,000 host entries, and in 
LPM mode, it can support 128,000 prefixes. Junos OS provides 
configurable options through a CLI so that each QFX5100 can be 
optimized for different deployment scenarios. 

Intelligent Buffer Management
The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch has 
a total of 12 MB shared buffers. While 25% of the total buffer 
space is dedicated, the rest is shared among all ports and is 
user configurable. The intelligent buffer mechanism in the 
QFX5100 effectively absorbs traffic bursts while providing 
deterministic performance, significantly increasing performance 
over static allocation.

Data SheetQFX5100 Application Acceleration Switch Cloud Analytics Engine

The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch 
supports the Juniper Networks Cloud Analytics Engine, providing 
critical network performance data to improve application 
performance and availability. Cloud Analytics Engine performs 
data collection, correlation, and visualization to help customers 
better understand workload and application behavior across the 
physical and virtual infrastructure.

Insight Technology for Analytics

The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch provides 
dynamic buffer utilization monitoring and reporting, with an 
interval of 10 milliseconds to provide microburst and latency 
insight. It calculates both queue depth and latency, and logs 
messages when configured thresholds are crossed. Interface traffic 
statistics can be monitored at two-second granularity. The data 
can be viewed via CLI, system log, or streamed to external servers 
for more analysis. Supported reporting formats include Java Script 
Object Notification (JSON), comma-separated values (CSV), and 
tab-separated values (TSV). These files can be consumed by 
orchestration systems, SDN controllers, or network management 
applications (such as Junos Space Network Director) to make 
better network design decisions and identify network hotspots.

MPLS

The QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch supports 
a broad set of MPLS features, including L3 VPN, IPv6 provider 
edge router (6PE), RSVP traffic engineering, and LDP to allow 
standards-based network segmentation and virtualization. The 

QFX5100 can be deployed as a low-latency MPLS label-switching 
router (LSR) or MPLS PE router in smaller scale environments. The 
QFX5100 is the industry’s only compact, low-latency, high-density, 
low power switch to offer an MPLS feature set.

IP Clos Fabric

The QFX5100-24Q-AA switches can be used either as a leaf or as 
a spine and a leaf, depending on the topology (see Figures 2 and 
3, respectively).

FCoE

As a Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit switch, the 
QFX5100-24Q-AA Application Acceleration switch provides an 
IEEE data center bridging (DCB) converged network between 
FCoE-enabled servers and an FCoE-enabled Fibre Channel 
storage area network (SAN). The QFX5100 offers a full-featured 
DCB implementation that provides strong monitoring capabilities 
on the top-of-rack switch for SAN and LAN administration teams 
to maintain clear separation of management. In addition, FCoE 
Initiation Protocol (FIP) snooping provides perimeter protection, 
ensuring that the presence of an Ethernet layer does not impact 
existing SAN security policies. FCoE link aggregation group (LAG) 
active/active support is available to achieve resilient (dual-rail) 
FCoE connectivity. 

The FCoE transit switch functionality, including priority-based 
flow control (PFC), Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), and 
Data Center Bridging Capability Exchange (DCBX), are included 
as part of the default software.
