The QFX5200 fixed-configuration 
access switch is ideally suited 
for leaf deployments in next-
generation IP fabric networks. It 
features line-rate, high-density 
QSFP+/QSFP28 ports that 
support 10GbE, 25GbE, 40GbE, 
50GbE, and 100GbE connections. 
Offering an advanced L2, L3, 
and MPLS feature set, network 
operators can use the QFX5200 
to build large, high-density IP 
fabrics that support upgrades 
to 25GbE servers, network 
virtualization, and intelligent 
traffic forwarding based on 
proven, Internet-scale technology. 
The QFX5200 also supports a 
disaggregated version of Junos 
software in which control plane 
and data plane processes and 
functions run in parallel to 
maximize utilization of the high-
performance quad-core CPU. 

Product Description 
Network operators are increasingly deploying scale-out, spine-and-leaf IP fabric 
architectures, built with fixed-configuration switches to support growing east-west 
traffic in the data center. The Juniper Networks® QFX5200 line of next-generation, fixed-
configuration leaf/access switches offers flexible, cost-effective, high-density 10GbE, 
25GbE, 40GbE, 50GbE, and 100GbE interfaces for server and intra-fabric connectivity, 
providing deployment versatility, investment protection, and future-proofing for today’s 
data centers.

In addition to leaf deployments in IP fabric architectures, the QFX5200 switch is also a 
great fit for multitier, multichassis link aggregation (MC-LAG) network implementations 
commonly used in enterprise networks.   

Like other QFX Series switches, the QFX5200 supports advanced Layer 2, Layer 3, and 
MPLS features. For large public cloud providers—among the first to adopt 25GbE servers 
to meet explosive workload growth—the QFX5200 enables very large, dense, and fast IP 
fabrics based on proven, Internet scale technology. 

The QFX5200 runs the same reliable, high-performance Juniper Networks Junos 
operating system used by network operators around the world. The QFX5200 supports 
a disaggregated version of Junos software with a modular architecture that allows 
the switch’s control plane and data plane processes and functions to run in parallel, 
maximizing utilization of the high-performance quad-core CPU.

Architecture and Key Components
The QFX5200 can be used in L3 fabrics and L2 networks with 
with MC-LAG. Customers can choose the architecture that best 
suits their deployment needs and easily adapt and evolve as 
requirements change over time. The QFX5200 switch serves as 
the universal building block for these two switching architectures, 
enabling data center operators to build cloud networks their way.

•  Layer 3 Fabric: For customers looking to build scale-out 
data centers, a Layer 3 spine-and-leaf Clos fabric is ideal 
due to its predictable, nonblocking performance and 
scale characteristics. For example, a two-tier fabric built 
with QFX5200 switches as leafs and Juniper Networks 
QFX10000 switches as the spine can scale to support up to 
18,432 40GbE ports, or 36,864 25GbE or 10GbE server ports 
in a single fabric.

  One of the most complicated tasks in building an IP fabric 
is assigning all of the implementation details, including IP 
addresses, BGP autonomous system (AS) numbers, routing 
policies, loopback address assignments, and many others. 
Automating the creation of an IP fabric at a large scale is 
equally difficult. To address these challenges, Juniper has 
created the OpenClos project to provide free and open-
source tools that automate the creation of IP fabrics in the 
data center. A set of Python scripts developed as an open-
source project that live on GitHub, OpenClos takes a set of 
inputs that describe the shape and size of a data center and 
outputs switch configuration files, as well as a cabling plan.

•  MC-LAG: The QFX5200 supports the MC-LAG protocol 

between two switches to eliminate Spanning Tree Protocol 
(STP) in traditional L2 networks when deployed in the 
aggregation layer. The active/active operation of MC-LAG 
ensures complete bandwidth utilization between the 
network’s access and aggregation layers, while the dual 
control plane technology ensures the highest availability 
for applications.

The QFX5200 runs the same Junos OS used by all other Juniper 
Networks QFX Series and EX Series Ethernet Switches, as well 
as the Juniper routers that power the world’s largest and most 
complex networks.

By using a common operating system, Juniper delivers a 
consistent implementation and operation of control plane 
features across all products. Junos OS employs a highly available 
modular architecture that prevents isolated failures from bringing 
down an entire system. Key Junos OS features that enhance the 
functionality and capabilities of the QFX5200 include:

•  Software modularity, with process modules running 

independently in their own protected memory space and 
with the ability to do process restarts

•  Commit and rollback functionality, which ensures error-free 

network configurations

•  A powerful set of scripts for on-box problem detection, 

reporting, and resolution

•  Flow path analysis: QFX5200 supports the Cloud Analytics 

Engine’s automated application flow path analysis by 
responding to application probe packets with probe ingress 
and egress timestamps and rich network statistics such as 
ingress interface, hash computed egress interface, queue 
stats, interface error, bandwidth utilization at ingress, 
equal-cost multipath (ECMP) group load distribution, and 
more. The QFX5200 also reports underlay network path 
information and overlay tunnel bandwidth utilization on the 
switch in response to overlay probe packets for overlay and 
underlay correlation.

•  MPLS: The QFX5200 supports a broad set of MPLS 

features, including L3 VPN, RSVP traffic engineering, and 
LDP to support standards-based multitenancy and network 
virtualization with per-flow SLAs at scale. The QFX5200 
can also be deployed as a low-latency MPLS label-
switching router (LSR) or MPLS provider edge (PE) router in 
smaller scale environments. The QFX5200 and the Juniper 
Networks QFX5100 switch are the industry’s most compact, 
low-latency, high-density, low power family of switches to 
offer an MPLS feature set. 

•  FCoE: As a Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) transit 

switch, the QFX5200 provides an IEEE data center bridging 
(DCB) converged network between FCoE-enabled servers 
and an FCoE-to-FC gateway or FCoE-enabled Fibre 
Channel storage area network (SAN). The QFX5200 offers 
a full-featured DCB implementation that provides strong 
monitoring capabilities on the top-of-rack switch for SAN 
and LAN administration teams to maintain clear separation 
of management. In addition, FCoE Initialization Protocol 
(FIP) snooping provides perimeter protection, ensuring 
that the presence of an Ethernet layer does not impact 
existing SAN security policies. FCoE LAG support transports 
FCoE traffic and regular Ethernet traffic across the same 

link aggregation bundle over ports on a converged network 
adapter (CNA) while guaranteeing that the same physical 
link is used for an FCoE point-to-point virtual connection.

  The FCoE transit switch functionality, including priority-

based flow control (PFC) and Data Center Bridging 
Capability Exchange (DCBX), are included as part of the 
default software.
