SRX4100 and SRX4200  
Services Gateways

Product Overview

The SRX4100 and SRX4200 
Services Gateways offer 
outstanding protection, 
performance, scalability, 
availability, and integrated 
security services. Designed 
for high-performance security 
services architectures and 
seamless integration of 
networking and security in a 
single platform, the SRX4100 
and SRX4200 are best suited 
for enterprise data centers, 
campuses, and regional 
headquarters, with a focus on 
application visibility and control, 
intrusion prevention, advanced 
threat protection, autnentication, 
confidentiality of information, and 
integrated cloud-based security. 
Both devices are powered by 
Junos OS, the industry-leading 
operating system that keeps the 
world’s largest mission-critical 
enterprise networks secure. 

 

Product Description 
The Juniper Networks® SRX4100 and SRX4200 Services Gateways are high-performance, 
next-generation firewalls and hardware-accelerated security services gateways that protect 
mission-critical data center networks, enterprise campuses, and regional headquarters. The 
SRX4100 and SRX4200 not only provide best-in-class security and advanced threat mitigation 
capabilities, they also integrate carrier-class routing in the same platform. 

The SRX4100 and SRX4200 deliver a next-generation security solution that supports 
the changing needs of cloud-enabled enterprise networks. Whether rolling out new 
services in an enterprise data center or campus, connecting to the cloud, complying 
with industry standards, or achieving operational efficiency, the SRX4100 and SRX4200 
help organizations realize their business objectives while providing scalability, ease of 
management, secure connectivity, and advanced threat mitigation capabilities. The 
SRX4100 and SRX4200 protect key corporate assets as next-generation firewalls, act as 
enforcement points for cloud-based security solutions, and provide application visibility 
and control to improve the user and application experience.

Architecture and Key Components
The SRX4100 and SRX4200 hardware and software architecture provides cost-effective 
security performance in a small 1 U form factor. Purpose-built to protect up to 40 Gbps 
Internet Mix (IMIX) firewall throughput network environments, the SRX4100 and SRX4200 
incorporate multiple security services and networking functions on top of the industry-
leading Juniper Networks Junos® operating system. The SRX4100 supports up to 20 Gbps 
(IMIX) of firewall performance, 7 Gbps of next-generation firewall (application security, 
intrusion prevention, enhanced URL filtering, and logging), and 5 Gbps of IPsec VPN in 
data center, enterprise campus, and regional headquarter deployments with IMIX traffic 
patterns. The SRX4200 supports up to 40 Gbps of firewall performance, 15 Gbps of next-
generation firewall, and up to 9.6 Gbps of IPsec VPN in data center, enterprise campus, and 
regional headquarter deployments with IMIX traffic patterns.

1 Performance, capacity and features listed are based on systems running Junos OS 15.1x49 and are measured under ideal testing 

conditions. Actual results may vary based on Junos OS releases and by deployments.

2 Next-generation firewall (NGFW) is a combination of advanced features such as application security, IPS, and URLF in addition 

to the foundational services such as logging and stateful firewall.

Data SheetThe SRX4100 and SRX4200 recognize more than 3,500 
applications and nested applications in plain-text or SSL-
encrypted transactions. The firewalls also integrate with 

Microsoft Active Directory and combine user information with 
application data to provide network-wide application and user 
visibility and control.
