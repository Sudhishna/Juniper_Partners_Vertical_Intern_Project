Optical Inline Amplifier

Product Overview

To meet the ever-increasing 
demands of metro networks, 
service providers and content 
providers are requiring high-
capacity, compact, and easy-to-
manage next-generation DWDM 
solutions. Juniper’s Optical Inline 
Amplifier provides high-capacity 
coherent DWDM transport with 
industry-leading performance and 
automation.

Product Description 
Juniper Networks® Optical Inline Amplifier is a standalone 1 U bidirectional erbium-doped 
fiber amplifier (EDFA) that provides periodic amplification of coherent dense wavelength-
division multiplexing (DWDM) signals to enable long-distance transmission as it travels 
along a fiber span. 

The Optical Inline Amplifier is a switched gain inline amplifier that provides a fully 
automatic and dynamic amplifier range (0-35 dB) supporting up to 120 channels in the 
C-band. Combined with Juniper’s integrated Coherent DWDM PICs (PTX-5-100G-WDM) 
and MICs (MIC3-100G-DWDM), as well as the Integrated Photonics Line Card (IPLC-E-32), 
Juniper provides a true end-to-end packet optical solution. The Optical Inline Amplifier 
automatically provisions all photonic layer parameters and discovers the optical topologies 
across a DWDM network. Junos® Space Connectivity Services Director is used to provision, 
monitor, and troubleshoot Juniper’s end-to-end packet optical solution, including the 
Optical Inline Amplifier.
